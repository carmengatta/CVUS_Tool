Pension Plan\nOpinion\nWe have audited the financial statements of The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. Pension Plan (the Plan),\nan employee benefit plan subject to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA), which\ncomprise the statements of net assets available for benefits as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the\nrelated statement of changes in net assets available for benefits for the year ended December 31, 2024, and\nthe related notes to the financial statements.\nIn our opinion, the accompanying financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the net assets\navailable for benefits of the Plan as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the changes in its net assets\navailable for benefits for the year ended December 31, 2024, in accordance with accounting principles\ngenerally accepted in the United States of America.\nBasis for Opinion\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of\nAmerica (GAAS). Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditors'\nResponsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements section of our report. We are required to be\nindependent of the Plan and to meet our other ethical responsibilities, in accordance with the relevant ethical\nrequirements relating to our audits. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and\nappropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion.\nResponsibilities of Management for the Financial Statements\nManagement is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the financial statements in accordance\nwith accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, and for the design,\nimplementation and maintenance of internal control relevant to the preparation and fair presentation of\nfinancial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\nIn preparing the financial statements, management is required to evaluate whether there are conditions or\nevents, considered in the aggregate, that raise substantial doubt about the Plan's ability to continue as a\ngoing concern within one year after the date that the financial statements are available to be issued.\nManagement is also responsible for maintaining a current plan instrument, including all plan amendments,\nadministering the Plan, and determining that the Plan's transactions that are presented and disclosed in the\nfinancial statements are in conformity with the Plan's provisions, including maintaining sufficient records with\nrespect to each of the participants, to determine the benefits due or which may become due to such\nparticipants.\nBaker Tilly Advisory Group, LP and Baker Tilly US, LLP, trading as Baker Tilly, are members of the global network of Baker Tilly\nInternational Ltd., the members of which are separate and independent legal entities. Baker Tilly US, LLP is a licensed CPA firm that\nprovides assurance services to its clients. Baker Tilly Advisory Group, LP and its subsidiary entities provide tax and consulting services\nto their clients and are not licensed CPA firms.\n1\n\nAuditors' Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements\nOur objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free\nfrom material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditors' report that includes our\nopinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance but is not absolute assurance and therefore is not\na guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with GAAS will always detect a material misstatement\nwhen it exists. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one\nresulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations or the\noverride of internal control. Misstatements are considered material if there is a substantial likelihood that,\nindividually or in the aggregate, they would influence the judgment made by a reasonable user based on the\nfinancial statements.\nIn performing an audit in accordance with GAAS, we:\n\u2022 Exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit.\n\u2022 Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to\nfraud or error, and design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks. Such procedures\ninclude examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial\nstatements.\n\u2022 Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures\nthat are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the\neffectiveness of the Plan's internal control. Accordingly, no such opinion is expressed.\n\u2022 Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of significant\naccounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluate the overall presentation of the\nfinancial statements.\n\u2022 Conclude whether, in our judgment, there are conditions or events, considered in the aggregate, that\nraise substantial doubt about the Plan's ability to continue as a going concern for a reasonable period\nof time.\nWe are required to communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the\nplanned scope and timing of the audit, significant audit findings and certain internal control-related matters\nthat we identified during the audit.\nSupplemental Schedules Required by ERISA\nOur audits were conducted for the purpose of forming an opinion on the financial statements as a whole. The\nsupplemental schedules, Schedule H, Line 4(i) - Schedule of Assets (Held at End of Year) and Schedule H,\nLine 4(j) - Schedule of Reportable Transactions as of or for the year ended December 31, 2024 are presented\nfor purposes of additional analysis and are not a required part of the financial statements but are\nsupplementary information required by the Department of Labor's (DOL) Rules and Regulations for Reporting\nand Disclosure under ERISA. Such information is the responsibility of management and was derived from and\nrelates directly to the underlying accounting and other records used to prepare the financial statements. The\ninformation has been subjected to the auditing procedures applied in the audits of the financial statements\nand certain additional procedures, including comparing and reconciling such information directly to the\nunderlying accounting and other records used to prepare the financial statements or to the financial\nstatements themselves, and other additional procedures in accordance with GAAS.\nIn forming our opinion on the supplemental schedules, we evaluated whether the supplemental schedules,\nincluding their form and content, are presented in conformity with the DOL's Rules and Regulations for\nReporting and Disclosure under ERISA.\n2\n\nIn our opinion, the information in the accompanying schedules is fairly stated, in all material respects, in\nrelation to the financial statements as a whole, and the form and content are presented in conformity with the\nDOL's Rules and Regulations for Reporting and Disclosure under ERISA.\nPittsburgh, Pennsylvania\nOctober 14, 2025\n3\n\nThe PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.

Pension Plan (the Plan or the PNC\nPension Plan) is provided for general information only. Participants should refer to the plan document for\na more complete description of the Plan's provisions.\nGeneral\nThe PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. (PNC or the Company) is the sponsor of the Plan. The Plan\nis a noncontributory defined benefit pension plan covering substantially all full-time employees of\nPNC and participating subsidiaries who have completed a six-month service period, excluding\nemployees of certain subsidiaries, as defined in the plan document. Part-time employees, as defined\nby the Plan, must complete one year of service to be eligible to participate in the Plan. The Plan is\nsubject to the provisions of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA). The Plan\nis administered by the Administrative Committee appointed by the Chief Executive Officer of PNC.\nOn June 1, 2021, PNC acquired BBVA USA Bancshares, Inc. (BBVA). The BBVA USA Retirement\nPlan (the BBVA Plan) was merged into the PNC Pension Plan effective October 31, 2021 and legacy\nBBVA employees became eligible to participate in the PNC Pension Plan, subject to its terms. As of\nthe plan merger date, no changes to either Plan\u2019s design or benefits occurred. The BBVA Plan was a\ndefined benefit plan that covered regular, full-time employees and part-time employees who met\ncertain eligibility requirements, as defined by the BBVA Plan document. The BBVA Plan was closed\nto new and rehired employees effective January 1, 2003 and benefit accruals were frozen for all\nBBVA Plan participants effective January 1, 2018.\nThe BBVA Plan trust did not merge into the PNC Pension Plan trust on October 31, 2021. Instead,\nimmediately after the plan merger, the PNC Pension Plan was funded by both the BBVA Plan trust\nand the PNC Pension Plan trust and the assets of each of the trusts were available to pay the\nbenefits and expenses of the post-merger PNC Pension Plan without limitation and without regard to\na participant\u2019s predecessor plan. The BBVA Plan trust was merged with and into the PNC Pension\nPlan trust on December 1, 2021.\nPension Benefits\nThe Plan utilizes a cash balance account design. Each calendar quarter, PNC adds an earnings\ncredit to eligible participant accounts. Earnings credits are determined as a certain percentage of a\nparticipant's eligible compensation earned during that quarter. Prior to January 1, 2010: (1) the\npercentage applicable to legacy PNC participants was based upon the sum, as of the previous\nDecember 31, of the participant's whole years of age and whole years of credited service, ranging\nfrom 3 percent to 8 percent and (2) the percentage applicable to legacy National City Corporation\nparticipants was determined on a scale that combined age and years of service calculated during the\nmonths of each anniversary and birthday.\nEffective January 1, 2010, earnings credits for both legacy PNC participants and legacy National City\nCorporation participants were frozen at the level attained as of December 31, 2009, and all new\nparticipants on or after January 1, 2010, including legacy BBVA participants, are subject to a flat\n3 percent earnings credit.\nIn addition, interest credits are added to participant accounts each quarter, calculated on the balance\nof the participant accounts at the end of the preceding quarter. All participants in the Plan as of\nDecember 31, 2009 earn interest credits based on 30-year U.S. Treasury securities, subject to a\nminimum rate, while new participants on and after January 1, 2010, including legacy BBVA\nparticipants, are not subject to the minimum rate.\n6\n\nThe PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. Pension Plan\nNotes to Financial Statements\nDecember 31, 2024 and 2023\nVested legacy PNC participants are entitled to commence receipt of benefits under the Plan when\nthey terminate from employment with PNC and may generally elect to receive the value of their\naccumulated Plan benefits either as a lump sum distribution upon termination or as an annuity\npayable monthly for life. Legacy National City Corporation participants are entitled to commence\nreceipt of benefits under the Plan as of the later of termination of employment or attainment of age 55\nand may elect a partial lump-sum distribution plus an annuity, full lump sum, or a full annuity payable\nmonthly for life. Participants entering the Plan on or after January 1, 2010, including legacy BBVA\nparticipants, are entitled to commence receipt of benefits under the Plan as of the later of termination\nof employment or attainment of age 55 and may elect to receive the value of their accumulated Plan\nbenefits either as a lump sum distribution or as annuity payable monthly for life.\nAll participants may defer payment of their benefit until as late as the April 1st of the calendar year\nnext following the later of their required minimum distribution age as defined by the Secure 2.0 Act or\ntermination of employment, unless the cash balance is $7,000 ($5,000 prior to January 1, 2024) or\nless upon termination of employment, in which case the Plan will pay out the benefit immediately as a\nlump sum.\nDeath and Disability Benefits\nThe Plan provides for a death benefit in the event a participant dies before benefits begin and after\ncompleting three years of vesting service (or after reaching age 65 while employed by PNC). Effective\nfor participants who first qualified for PNC-provided short-term disability income prior to January 1,\n2011, and who became totally disabled during their employment with PNC, such participants continue\nto receive earnings credits as long as the participants continue to be totally disabled or until age 65, if\nearlier. Effective for participants who first qualify for PNC-provided short-term disability income on or\nafter January 1, 2011, and who subsequently incur a total disability, such participants continue to\nreceive earnings credits until the earlier of (i) the third year anniversary of the date upon which such\nparticipant's total disability commenced; (ii) the date such participant ceases to receive long-term\ndisability payments under the PNC-sponsored long-term disability plan covering such participant; or\n(iii)the date upon which such participant ceases to be a PNC employee. Earnings credits are added\nto a disabled participant's account based on his or her eligible compensation before the disability\nbegan. Interest credits will continue to be added to a disabled participant's account until his or her\naccount is distributed.\nAdministrative Expenses\nAdministrative expenses of the Plan, including, but not limited to, professional service, recordkeeping\nand trustee fees, are paid by the Plan, if not paid by the Company. Administrative expenses,\nconsisting primarily of investment management fees, of approximately $0.8 million were paid by the\nCompany on behalf of the Plan in 2024 and are excluded from these financial statements.\n2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\nBasis of Accounting\nThe financial statements of the Plan are prepared on the accrual basis of accounting.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in\nthe United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect\nthe reported amounts of assets, liabilities, and changes therein, disclosure of contingent assets and\nliabilities, and the actuarial present value of accumulated plan benefits at the date of the financial\nstatements. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates.\n7\n\nThe PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. Pension Plan\nNotes to Financial Statements\nDecember 31, 2024 and 2023\nInvestment Valuation and Income Recognition\nInvestments are reported at fair value. Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset\nor paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement\ndate. The Plan's Investment Committee determines the Plan's valuation policies utilizing information\nprovided by the Plan's custodians and investment advisors. See Note 3 for discussion of fair value\nmeasurements.\nPurchases and sales of securities are recorded on a trade-date basis. Interest income is accrued\nwhen earned. Dividends are recorded on the ex-dividend date. Net appreciation in fair value of\ninvestments includes the Plan's gains and losses on investments bought and sold as well as held\nduring the year.\nDerivatives\nThe Plan utilizes derivative instruments, including forwards, futures, options, swaptions, and swaps,\nprimarily to increase or decrease the exposure to risk within the Plan's investment portfolio. Under the\nFinancial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) authoritative guidance, the Plan recognizes the fair\nvalue of all its derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities within other assets in the\naccompanying statements of net assets available for benefits while the changes in fair value are\nrecorded as net appreciation (depreciation) in fair value of investments in the statement of changes in\nnet assets available for benefits.\nThe Plan's derivative instruments, or financial contracts whose value is based on, or derived from, a\ntraditional security, an asset, or a market index, are used by the Plan's investment managers within\nthe Plan's investments. The investment strategies include derivative instruments that may be either\ndirectly held, or indirectly held through investments in other commingled funds. Derivatives may\ninvolve market, liquidity, operational, or legal risks greater than those of traditional investments.\nApproximately $2.2 million of losses on investments in derivative instruments are included in net\nappreciation in fair value of investments in the accompanying statement of changes in net assets for\nthe year ended December 31, 2024.\nThe Plan may invest in derivatives to provide immediate exposure to fluctuations in the equity and\nbond markets in various countries or in the market value of index stocks, to reduce transaction costs,\nto provide liquidity for cash flows, to hedge dividend accruals or interest rate risk, to replicate the\nduration of various market indices, to seek higher investment returns, to manage currency risk, or to\ngain currency exposure. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the derivative instruments held by the\nPlan included foreign currency forward contracts, futures contracts, option contracts, swaptions, and\ninterest rate swap contracts.\nThe investment managers attempt to minimize risk of derivative transactions within the Plan's\ninvestments. Policies and procedures are established by the investment managers to monitor the\nexposure and limits on the type and value of the derivative instruments. The credit-worthiness of\npotential counterparties is evaluated and counterparty limits are established. The Plan's investment\nmanagers may negotiate and enter into collateral or netting agreements with counterparties on the\nPlan's behalf. In the event of a counterparty default, these agreements reduce the potential loss to the\nPlan. Collateral, in the form of cash or short-term investments, held by the Plan is included in\ninvestments, at fair value, in the accompanying statements of net assets available for benefits and is\nnot significant at December 31, 2024 or 2023.\nInvestments in foreign currency forward contracts are limited so that currency exposure will not\nexceed the asset exposure in a particular country. All futures contracts are conducted through\nregulated exchanges. Generally, the investment managers attempt to limit aforementioned risk\nexposure to the extent of fund value.\n8\n\nThe PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. Pension Plan\nNotes to Financial Statements\nDecember 31, 2024 and 2023\nMarket risk arises from the potential for changes in value of financial instruments resulting from\nfluctuations in interest and foreign exchange rates and in prices of debt and equity securities. The\nnotional (or contractual) amounts used to express the volume of these transactions do not necessarily\nrepresent the amounts potentially subject to market risk.\nAll derivative financial instruments are carried at fair value. The net fair value of derivative financial\ninstruments was a liability of approximately $4.8 million and an asset of approximately $1.2 million as\nof December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and is included within other investments in the\naccompanying statements of net assets available for benefits.\nThe fair value of the Plan's futures contracts, foreign currency forward contracts, swaptions, option\ncontracts, and interest rate swap contracts, as reported within investments, at fair value, in the\naccompanying statements of net assets available for benefits as of December 31, 2024 and 2023 is\nas follows (amounts in thousands):\nDecember 31, 2024\nNotional\nAmounts Assets Liabilities\nFutures contracts $ 62,902 $ 1,794 $ 1,131\nForeign currency forward contracts 16,169 16,169 15,989\nSwaptions 325,000 15,033 -\nOption contracts 2,120,234 81,587 99,273\nInterest rate swap contracts 2,075,983 7,630 10,604\nTotal $ 4,600,288 $ 122,213 $ 126,997\nDecember 31, 2023\nNotional\nAmounts Assets Liabilities\nFutures contracts $ 59,070 $ 1,999 $ 9,609\nForeign currency forward contracts 3,000 - 30\nSwaptions 325,000 27,960 -\nOption contracts 1,765,593 43,755 78,676\nInterest rate swap contracts 1,575,017 31,162 15,385\nTotal $ 3,727,680 $ 104,876 $ 103,700\nThe net effect of derivative investments, as reported within net appreciation in fair value of\ninvestments, in the statement of changes in net assets available for benefits for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2024 is as follows (amounts in thousands):\nOption contracts $ (16,122)\nSwaptions (12,926)\nInterest rate swap contracts 20,899\nForeign currency forward contracts 664\nFutures contracts 5,293\nTotal $ (2,192)\n9\n\nThe PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. Pension Plan\nNotes to Financial Statements\nDecember 31, 2024 and 2023\nActuarial Present Value of Accumulated Plan Benefits\nAccumulated plan benefits are those future periodic payments, including lump-sum distributions,\nwhich are attributable under the Plan's provisions to the service employees have rendered.\nAccumulated plan benefits include benefits expected to be paid to (a) retired or terminated employees\nor their beneficiaries, (b) beneficiaries of employees who have died, and (c) present employees or\ntheir beneficiaries. Accumulated plan benefits for retired or terminated employees prior to January 1,\n1999 or their beneficiaries are based on a formula, which generally includes the average of the\nparticipant's compensation as described in the Plan preceding a participant's separation from service.\nThe accumulated plan benefits for active employees and retirees after January 1, 1999 are generally\nbased on a cash balance account plan design, determined under the provisions of the Plan.\nPayment of Benefits\nBenefit payments to participants are recorded upon distribution.\nSubsequent Events\nThe Plan has evaluated subsequent events for recognition or disclosure through October 14, 2025,\nthe date the financial statements were available to be issued.\n3. Fair Value Measurements\nThe framework for measuring fair value provides a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to\nvaluation techniques used to measure fair value. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted\nquoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1) and the lowest priority to\nunobservable inputs (Level 3). The three levels of the fair value hierarchy under authoritative guidance\nare described as follows:\nLevel 1 - Inputs to the valuation methodology are unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or\nliabilities in active markets that the Plan has the ability to access.\nLevel 2 - Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or\nliability, either directly or indirectly, such as:\n\u2022 quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets;\n\u2022 quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in inactive markets;\n\u2022 inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability;\n\u2022 inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by\ncorrelation or other means.\nIf the asset or liability has a specified (contractual) term, the Level 2 input must be observable for\nsubstantially the full term of the asset or liability.\nLevel 3 - Inputs to the valuation methodology are unobservable and significant to the fair value\nmeasurement.\nThe asset or liability's fair value measurement level within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest\nlevel of any input that is significant to the fair value measurement. Valuation techniques maximize the use\nof relevant observables and minimize the use of unobservable inputs.\n10\n\nThe PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. Pension Plan\nNotes to Financial Statements\nDecember 31, 2024 and 2023\nFollowing is a description of the valuation methodologies used for assets measured at fair value. There\nhave been no changes in the methodologies used at December 31, 2024 and 2023:\nMoney market funds are valued at the quoted net asset value (NAV) of shares held by the Plan at\nyear end.\nMutual funds are valued at the daily closing price as reported by the fund. Mutual funds held by the\nPlan are open-end mutual funds that are registered with the U.S. Securities and Exchange\nCommission. These funds are required to publish their daily NAV and to transact at that price. The\nmutual funds held by the Plan are deemed to be actively traded. The NAV of certain mutual funds are\nnot listed on a national exchange; however, the NAV is considered readily determinable under FASB\nguidance.\nU.S. government securities, corporate debt, common stock and preferred stock are valued at the\nclosing price reported on the market on which the individual securities are traded or based on yields\ncurrently available on comparable securities of issuers with similar credit ratings.\nCollective trust funds are valued at the NAV of units of a bank collective trust, as provided by the\nfunds' trustees, to estimate fair value. The NAV is based on the fair value of the underlying\ninvestments held by the fund less its liabilities, and generally represents a readily determinable fair\nvalue based upon quoted market prices in an active market. The collective trust funds are valued at\nNAV; however not based on quoted market prices in an active market, and as such, the NAV, as\nprovided by the funds' trustees, is used as a practical expedient to estimate fair value.\nLimited partnerships are valued based upon the interests of such limited partnerships held by the\nPlan at year end multiplied by the respective NAV. The NAV is based on each partnership's current\ncondition and future cash flow projections or based on the Plan's share of undistributed earnings,\nwhich approximates fair value.\nOther investments held by the Plan include derivative financial instruments and real estate, which are\nrecorded at estimated fair value as determined by third-party appraisals and pricing models, and\ngroup annuity contracts which are valued at fair value by discounting the related cash flows based on\ncurrent yields of similar instruments with comparable durations considering the credit-worthiness of\nthe issuer.\n11\n\nThe PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. Pension Plan\nNotes to Financial Statements\nDecember 31, 2024 and 2023\nThe following table sets forth by level, within the fair value hierarchy, the Plan's assets at fair value as of\nDecember 31, 2024 (amounts in thousands):\nFair Value Measurements Using:\nSignificant\nQuoted Prices in Other Significant\nActive Markets Observable Unobservable\nfor Identical Inputs Inputs\nFair Value Assets (Level 1) (Level 2) (Level 3)\nMoney market funds $ 255,964 $ 255,964 $ - $ -\nU.S. government securities 692,543 390,957 301,586 -\nCorporate debt 686,708 - 685,401 1,307\nCommon and preferred stocks 410,048 409,931 117 -\nMutual funds 147,446 - 147,446 -\nOther 40,538 - 40,360 178\nTotal assets in the fair\nvalue hierarchy 2,233,247 $ 1,056,852 $ 1,174,910 $ 1,485\nInvestments measured at net\nasset value (a) 3,276,280\nTotal investments at\nfair value $ 5,509,527\nThe following table sets forth by level, within the fair value hierarchy, the Plan's assets at fair value as of\nDecember 31, 2023 (amounts in thousands):\nFair Value Measurements Using:\nSignificant\nQuoted Prices in Other Significant\nActive Markets Observable Unobservable\nfor Identical Inputs Inputs\nFair Value Assets (Level 1) (Level 2) (Level 3)\nMoney market funds $ 213,942 $ 213,942 $ - $ -\nU.S. government securities 538,307 393,742 144,565 -\nCorporate debt 751,055 - 749,356 1,699\nCommon and preferred stocks 715,920 715,801 119 -\nMutual funds 159,636 - 159,636 -\nOther 32,258 - 32,080 178\nTotal assets in the fair\nvalue hierarchy 2,411,118 $ 1,323,485 $ 1,085,756 $ 1,877\nInvestments measured at net\nasset value (a) 3,207,823\nTotal investments at\nfair value $ 5,618,941\n(a) Certain investments that were measured at NAV per share (or its equivalent) have not been classified\nin the fair value hierarchy.

Pension Plan\nNotes to Financial Statements\nDecember 31, 2024 and 2023\n4. Funding Policy\nThe Company's funding policy is to make contributions to the Plan each year that are at least as great as\nthe minimum required amount but no greater than the maximum tax-deductible amount. In addition, or in\nlieu of cash contributions, PNC may elect to use a portion of the available credit balance to satisfy\nminimum funding requirements. The Plan has met the minimum funding requirements of ERISA for 2024\nand 2023.\nAlthough it has not expressed any intention to do so, the Company has the right under the Plan to\ndiscontinue its contributions at any time and to terminate the Plan subject to the provisions set forth in\nERISA.\n5. Plan Termination\nIn the event the Plan terminates, the net assets of the Plan will be allocated, as prescribed by ERISA and\nits related regulations, generally to provide the following benefits in the order indicated:\n1. Current retirees or their beneficiaries.\n2. Other vested benefits insured by the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC)\n(a U.S. Governmental agency) up to the applicable limitations (discussed below).\n3. All other vested benefits (that is, vested benefits not insured by the PBGC).\n4. All nonvested benefits.\nCertain benefits under the Plan are insured by the PBGC if the Plan terminates. Generally, the PBGC\nguarantees most vested normal retirement age benefits, early retirement benefits and certain disability\nand survivors pensions. However, the PBGC does not guarantee all types of benefits under the Plan and\nthe amount of benefit protection is subject to certain limitations. Vested benefits under the Plan are\nguaranteed at the level in effect on the date of the Plan's termination. However, there is a statutory ceiling\non the amount of an individual's monthly benefit that the PBGC guarantees.\nWhether all participants receive their benefits should the Plan terminate at some future time will depend\non the sufficiency, at that time, of the Plan's net assets to provide those benefits and may also depend on\nthe level of benefits guaranteed by the PBGC.\n14\n\nThe PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. Pension Plan\nNotes to Financial Statements\nDecember 31, 2024 and 2023\n6. Accumulated Plan Benefits\nThe actuarial present value of accumulated plan benefits is the amount that results from applying\nactuarial assumptions to adjust the accumulated plan benefits to reflect the time value of money (through\ndiscounts for interest) and the probability of payment (by means of decrements such as for death,\ndisability, withdrawal, or retirement) between the valuation date and the expected date of payment.\nThe actuarial present value of accumulated plan benefits as of December 31, 2024 and 2023 is as follows\n(amounts in thousands):\n2024 2023\nVested benefits:\nParticipants currently receiving payments $ 1,342,233 $ 1,282,292\nOther participants 2,971,702 2,683,967\nTotal vested benefits 4,313,935 3,966,259\nNonvested benefits 38,196 36,468\nTotal actuarial present value of accumulated plan\nbenefits $ 4,352,131 $ 4,002,727\nThe changes in the actuarial present value of accumulated plan benefits for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2024 are as follows (amounts in thousands):\nActuarial present value of accumulated plan benefits at\nbeginning of year $ 4,002,727\nIncrease (decrease) during the year attributable to:\nBenefits accumulated 108,443\nActuarial losses 34,358\nInterest due to decrease in discount period 258,517\nBenefits paid (388,488)\nChanges in actuarial assumptions 336,574\nNet increase 349,404\nActuarial present value of accumulated plan benefits at\nend of year $ 4,352,131\nSignificant actuarial assumptions underlying the actuarial computations are as follows:\na. Interest rate \u2013 6.10 percent for 2024 and 6.60 percent for 2023.\nb. Life expectancy of participants \u2013 Pri-2012 table projected using mortality improvement scale MP-\n2021 in 2024 and 2023.\nc. Average retirement age - Age 62 in 2024 and 2023 for active participants.\nDuring 2024, due to various changes in actuarial assumptions, including changes in the discount rate for\nbenefit obligations and changes in interest crediting rates for certain participant groups, the actuarial\npresent value of accumulated plan benefits increased by approximately $336.6 million.\nThe foregoing actuarial assumptions are based on the presumption that the Plan will continue. Were the\nPlan to terminate, different actuarial assumptions and other factors might be applicable in determining the\nactuarial present value of accumulated plan benefits.\n15\n\nThe PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. Pension Plan\nNotes to Financial Statements\nDecember 31, 2024 and 2023\n7. Related-Party and Party In Interest Transactions\nContributions are held and managed by the custodians of the Plan, who invest cash received, interest\nand dividend income and make distributions to participants. Certain of the Plan\u2019s investments are\nmanaged by an affiliate of a custodian of the Plan. These transactions qualify as party in interest\ntransactions which are exempt from the prohibited transactions rules of ERISA.\nThe Plan paid certain expenses related to plan operations and investment activity to various service\nproviders, which were not significant in 2024. Additionally, certain administrative functions of the Plan are\nperformed by officers or employees of the Company.\n8. Tax Status\nThe Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has determined and informed the Company by a letter dated\nMarch 8, 2021, that the Plan and related trust are designed in accordance with applicable sections of the\nInternal Revenue Code (IRC). Although the Plan has been amended since receiving the determination\nletter, the Plan administrator believes that the Plan is designed and is currently being operated in\ncompliance with the applicable requirements of the IRC and therefore believes that the Plan is qualified\nand the related trust is tax exempt.\nAccounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America require management to\nevaluate tax positions taken by the Plan and recognize a tax liability if the Plan has taken an uncertain\nposition that more likely than not would not be sustained upon examination by the IRS. The Plan is\nsubject to routine audits by taxing jurisdictions; however, there are currently no audits for any tax periods\nin progress.\n9. Risks and Uncertainties\nThe Plan invests in various investment securities. Investment securities are exposed to various risks such\nas interest rate, market, and credit risks. Market risks include global events which could impact the value\nof investment securities, such as a pandemic or international conflict. Due to the level of risk associated\nwith certain investment securities, it is at least reasonably possible that changes in the values of\ninvestment securities will occur in the near term and that such changes could materially affect the\namounts reported in the statements of net assets available for benefits.\nPlan contributions are made and the actuarial present value of accumulated plan benefits is reported\nbased on certain assumptions pertaining to interest rates, inflation rates and employee demographics, all\nof which are subject to change. Due to uncertainties inherent in the estimations and assumptions\nprocess, it is at least reasonably possible that changes in these estimates and assumptions in the near\nterm would be material to the financial statements.\n16\n\nThe PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.

These rules produce\nsmoothed values that reflect the underlying market value of plan\nassets but fluctuate less than the market value. As a result, the\nactuarial value of assets will be lower than the market value in\nsome years and greater in other years. However, over the long\nterm under PPA\u2019s smoothing rules, the method has a bias to\nproduce an actuarial value of assets that is below the market value\nof assets.\nPlan Name: The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.

Information on assets, contributions, and plan provisions was supplied by the plan\nsponsor. Data and other information were reviewed for reasonableness and consistency, but no audit was\nperformed. Based on discussions with the plan sponsor, assumptions, or estimates were made when\ndata were not available, and the data was adjusted to reflect any significant events that occurred between\nthe date the data was collected and the measurement date.\nWe are not aware of any errors or omissions in the data that would have a significant effect on the results\nof our calculations.\nAssumptions Rationale - Significant Economic Assumptions\nDiscount rate The basis chosen was selected by the plan sponsor from among\nchoices prescribed by law, all of which are based on observed market\ndata over certain periods of time.\nCash balance interest crediting The plan credits interest to cash balance accounts using the 30-year\nrate Treasury rate, but with a minimum interest credit rate of 4.40% for\nlegacy PNC participants and 3.79% for legacy NCC participants.\nParticipants hired on or after January 1, 2010 are not subject to a\nminimum rate.\nThe rates chosen are based on the expected future difference, based\non the historical difference, and considering the increase in interest\ncrediting expected to be caused by the minimum interest credit rates,\nbetween the high-quality corporate bond rates used to determine the\nplan\u2019s discount rate used for corporate accounting and the cash\nbalance account interest crediting rates.\nWe believe that the selected assumption does not significantly conflict\nwith what would be reasonable.\nPlan Name: The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.
