The Plan is subject to routine audits by taxing\njurisdictions; however, there are currently no audits for any tax periods in progress. The\nAdministrator believes it is no longer subject to income tax examinations for years prior to 2021.\n4. Actuarial Present Value of Accumulated Plan Benefits\nAccumulated plan benefits are those future periodic payments that are attributable under the Plan\u2019s\nprovisions for services rendered by employees through the valuation date. Accumulated plan\nbenefits include benefits expected to be paid to retired or terminated employees or their\nbeneficiaries, beneficiaries of employees who have died, and present employees or their\nbeneficiaries. The accumulated plan benefits for active employees as of December 31, 2024 are\nbased on average compensation during the applicable period ended December 31, 2024. Benefits\npayable under all circumstances, including retirement, death, and termination of employment, are\nincluded to the extent they are deemed attributable to the employee\u2019s service rendered through the\nvaluation date.\nThe actuarial present value of accumulated plan benefits as of December 31, 2024 and 2023 was\nas follows:\n(Thousands of Dollars) 2024 2023\nVested Benefits:\nParticipants Currently Receiving Payments $ 2,641,367 $ 2,597,632\nActive Employees and Terminated Employees 954,087 967,743\nTotal Vested Benefits 3,595,454 3,565,375\nNonvested Benefits \u2013 Active Employees 32,264 33,293\nActuarial Present Value of Accumulated Plan Benefits $ 3,627,718 $ 3,598,668\nThe changes in the actuarial present value of the Plan\u2019s accumulated plan benefits for the year\nended December 31, 2024 were as follows:\n(Thousands of Dollars) 2024\nActuarial Present Value of Accumulated Plan Benefits, Beginning of Year $ 3,598,668\nIncrease/(Decrease) During the Year Attributable to:\nInterest Cost 283,255\nActuarial (Gain)/Loss 44,547\nBenefits Accumulated During the Year 39,091\nAssumption Changes (610)\nBenefits Paid Directly to Participants (337,233)\nNet Increase 29,050\nActuarial Present Value of Accumulated Plan Benefits, End of Year $ 3,627,718\n14\n\nThe actuarial present value of accumulated plan benefits is actuarially determined and is the\namount that results from applying actuarial assumptions to adjust the accumulated plan benefits to\nreflect the time value of money (through discounts for interest) and the probability of payment (by\nmeans of decrements such as for death, disability, withdrawal or retirement) between the valuation\ndate and the expected dates of payment.\nSignificant actuarial assumptions used in these valuations as of December 31, 2024 and 2023\nwere as follows:\nLife expectancy: Based on the Pri-2012 Employee and Retiree Table and the Pri-\n2012 Contingent Survivor Table for beneficiaries in payment\nstatus, Projected with Scale MP-2021\nRetirement: Employees will retire at varying rates based on age and service\nas specified in the annual valuation.\n2024 2023\nDiscount Rate (Expected Rate of Return on Plan Assets) 8.25% 8.25%\nActuarial gains and losses represent the differences between actuarial assumptions and actual plan\nexperience. The actuarial loss of $44.5 million on the Plan\u2019s accumulated plan benefits related to\nitems of plan experience, primarily reflecting updated census data relative to the actuarial\nassumption. The increase due to benefits accumulated during the year of $39.1 million related to\nnormal operation of the Plan for ongoing benefit accruals. The change in actuarial assumptions of\n$0.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2024 related to a change in the applicable 417(e)\nassumptions and cash balance interest crediting rate assumption.\nThe foregoing assumptions are based on the presumption that the Plan will continue. If the Plan\nwere to terminate, different actuarial assumptions and other factors might be applicable in\ndetermining the actuarial present value of accumulated plan benefits.\n5. Master Trust Account \u2013 Summarized Financial Information\nContributions to the Plan, if any, are used to purchase units of participation in the Master Trust.\nThe Plan\u2019s interest income and realized and unrealized appreciation or depreciation in the fair\nvalue of the invested assets of the Master Trust, net of investment management fees, are based on\nthe allocation to the Plan by the trustee based on the Plan\u2019s units of participation.\nThe Plan\u2019s interest in the Master Trust is based upon the value as certified by the trustee. As of\nDecember 31, 2024 and 2023, the Plan\u2019s interest in the net assets of the Master Trust, which\nexcludes the 401(h) account, was 94 percent. The 401(h) account\u2019s interest in the net assets of the\nMaster Trust was four percent and Aquarion Pension Plan\u2019s interest in the net assets of the Master\nTrust was two percent as of December 31, 2024 and 2023.\n15\n\nES Pension Offshore Portfolio Ltd.: ES Pension Offshore Portfolio Ltd. (the SPV) is an exempted\ninvestment company (exempted from registration under the Investment Company Act by virtue of\nSection 3(c)(7) (among others)), which was incorporated on March 25, 2024 with limited liability\nunder the laws of the Cayman Islands, and commenced operations on June 1, 2024. The SPV is\nwholly-owned by the Master Trust. The SPV is a special purpose vehicle that was formed to hold\ncollateral assets of the Master Trust to support a $400 million credit facility entered into by the\nSPV with Bank of America, N.A. The assets were transferred into the SPV from the Master Trust.\nThe credit facility is a line of credit with the purpose of providing liquidity to the Master Trust,\nthrough the SPV, to support pension benefit payments of the Eversource and Aquarion Pension\nPlans, capital calls and liability hedging costs if necessary. The Master Trust's and the SPV's assets\nare held by the trustee and the trustee is responsible for the trust and custody of the Master Trust's\nassets, which include the SPV's assets. The assets of the SPV represent 15 percent of the net assets\nof the Master Trust as of December 31, 2024.\nOn July 26, 2024, the SPV entered into a $400 million credit facility with Bank of America, N.A.\nThe credit facility has a one-year term, with one-year extensions on a rolling basis. All borrowings\nunder the line of credit are collateralized by a first security interest in the assets of the SPV. The\ninterest terms associated with the credit facility are SOFR plus 1.50%. There is also a commitment\nfee of 0.40% per year on the undrawn amount. There were no borrowings on the credit facility as\nof December 31, 2024 or during the period June 1, 2024 (commencement of operations) through\nOctober 2, 2025, and as a result the Plan paid approximately $0.6 million of the annual\ncommitment fee, which is reflected in Administrative Expenses on the Statement of Changes in\nNet Assets Available for Benefits for the year ended December 31, 2024.\nAs of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Master Trust\u2019s net assets (including those of the 401(h)\naccount and the Aquarion Pension Plan, and excluding the activity of the guaranteed insurance\ncontracts), and the amount of the Plan\u2019s interest in each asset consisted of the following at fair\nvalue:\n2024\nPlan\u2019s Interest in\nMaster Trust Master Trust\n(Thousands of Dollars) Balances Balances\nCorporate Stocks $ 22,092 $ 20,670\nCorporate Debt Instruments 5,120 4,790\nUnited States Government Securities 333,524 312,056\nInterest in Common/Collective Trusts 1,497,079 1,400,715\nInterest in 103-12 Investment Entities 61,551 57,589\nInterest in Registered Investment Companies 324,568 303,676\nInterest in Partnership/Joint Ventures 3,435,978 3,214,812\nCash 506,672 474,058\nOther Investments (1) (278,575) (260,644)\nAccounts Receivable (2) 55,564 51,988\nAccounts Payable (3) (54,628) (51,111)\nTotal $ 5,908,945 $ 5,528,599\n16\n\n2023\nPlan\u2019s Interest in\nMaster Trust Master Trust\n(Thousands of Dollars) Balances Balances\nCorporate Stocks $ 24,886 $ 23,273\nCorporate Debt Instruments 252,821 236,441\nUnited States Government Securities 359,694 336,390\nInterest in Common/Collective Trusts 707,977 662,108\nInterest in 103-12 Investment Entities 56,772 53,094\nInterest in Registered Investment Companies 242,981 227,239\nInterest in Partnership/Joint Ventures 4,024,966 3,764,192\nCash 391,498 366,133\nOther Investments (1) (76,151) (71,217)\nAccounts Receivable (2) 78,593 73,501\nAccounts Payable (3) (45,650) (42,692)\nTotal $ 6,018,387 $ 5,628,462\n(1) Other Investments include derivative instruments and a net obligation to return securities\nreceived as collateral. The obligation to return collateral is generally offset by physical\nsecurities received as collateral within the Master Trust.\n(2) Accounts receivable includes receivables for investments sold (unsettled sales), dividends,\ninterest, and receivables related to foreign currency contracts and futures contracts.\n(3) Accounts payable includes payables for investments purchased (unsettled purchases), interest\npayable on short sales, payables related to futures contracts, and payables related to foreign\ncurrency contracts.\nThe following is a summary of the changes in the Master Trust\u2019s net assets, including those of the\n401(h) account and the Aquarion Pension Plan and excluding the activity of the guaranteed\ninsurance contracts, for the year ended December 31, 2024:\n(Thousands of Dollars) 2024\nAdditions:\nContributions $ 5,001\nNet Appreciation in the Fair Value of Investments 275,805\nTotal Additions 280,806\nDeductions:\nBenefit Payments 368,281\nAdministrative Expenses 21,967\nTotal Deductions 390,248\nDecrease in Net Assets (109,442)\nNet Assets \u2013 Beginning of Year 6,018,387\nNet Assets \u2013 End of Year $ 5,908,945\n17\n\nAs of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the following activity of the Master Trust and the amounts\nallocated to the Plan were as follows:\n(Thousands of Dollars) 2024 2023\nMaster Trust Accrued Interest Receivable $ 1,848 $ 4,352\nAccrued Interest Receivable Allocated to the Plan 1,729 4,073\nMaster Trust Unsettled Sales 51,815 52,223\nUnsettled Sales Allocated to the Plan 48,479 48,839\nMaster Trust Unsettled Purchases 49,231 19,845\nUnsettled Purchases Allocated to the Plan 46,062 18,559\nDerivative instruments used by investment managers of the Master Trust during the year ended\nDecember 31, 2024 included swap agreements, options, index futures contracts and forward\ncurrency contracts.\nSwap agreements are entered into to manage exposure to market risks and achieve certain\ninvestment objectives. Swaps are valued using pricing models that incorporate interest rates and\nequity and fixed income index closing prices to determine a net present value of the cash flows.\nSwaps are marked-to-market daily based on changes in the underlying asset or index valuation or\nchanges in interest rates, and any gains or losses are covered by cash or other collateral. The net\ndifference between the two receipts is exchanged at a predetermined settlement date. The mark-\nto-market related to swaps resulted in an unrealized loss of $82.6 million and an unrealized gain\nof $96.1 million, that was reported within Other Investments within the Master Trust as of\nDecember 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The notional associated with these swap agreements\ntotaled $1.78 billion and $1.05 billion as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nUnder futures contracts, the Master Trust makes or takes delivery of a standardized quantity of a\nspecified grade or type of commodity or financial instrument at a specified future date and at a\nspecified price in accordance with terms specified by a regulated futures exchange. Upon entering\ninto a futures contract, the Master Trust is required to deposit, either in cash or securities, an\namount (initial margin) equal to a certain percentage of the nominal value of the contract. The\nMaster Trust pays or receives cash depending on the daily fluctuation in the value of the underlying\ncontracts. Futures contracts are settled on a daily basis, which results in the daily recording of\ngains and losses and minimal book value balances of futures contracts.\n18\n\n6. Information Certified by Plan Trustee (Unaudited)\nThe Administrator has obtained certification from The Bank of New York Mellon that the Master\nTrust information as of December 31, 2024 and 2023 and for the year ended December 31, 2024\n(see Note 5, \u201cMaster Trust Account \u2013 Summarized Financial Information\u201d) is complete and\naccurate. The Administrator has also obtained certification from The Bank of New York Mellon\nthat the Plan\u2019s investments and investment activity are complete and accurate, as follows:\nAs of December 31,\n(Thousands of Dollars) 2024 2023\nInvestments:\nInterest in Master Trust $ 5,528,599 $ 5,628,462\nNet Assets Held in 401(h) Account 231,792 244,899\nGuaranteed Insurance Contracts 2,665 2,775\nFor the Year Ended\n(Thousands of Dollars) December 31, 2024\nInvestment Gain:\nNet Appreciation, Fair Value of Interest in Master Trust $ 243,437\nNet Appreciation, Fair Value of Net Assets Held in 401(h) Account 10,241\nInterest and Dividend Income on Guaranteed Insurance Contracts 111\n7. Fair Value Measurements\nThe Master Trust of the Plan discloses fair value measurements pursuant to a framework for\nmeasuring fair value in accordance with GAAP. The Plan follows a fair value hierarchy that\nprioritizes the inputs used to determine fair value and requires the Plan to classify assets and\nliabilities carried at fair value based on the observability of these inputs. The hierarchy gives the\nhighest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities and\nthe lowest priority to unobservable inputs. The levels of the fair value hierarchy are described as\nfollows:\nBasis of Fair Value Measurements\nLevel 1 Inputs are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or\nliabilities as of the reporting date. Active markets are those in which\ntransactions for the asset or liability occur in sufficient frequency and volume\nto provide pricing information on an ongoing basis.\nLevel 2 Inputs are quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets, quoted\nprices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active, and\nmodel-derived valuations in which all significant inputs are observable.\nLevel 3 Quoted market prices are not available. Fair value is derived from valuation\ntechniques in which one or more significant inputs or assumptions are\nunobservable. As of both December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Plan\u2019s interest in\nthe Master Trust did not include any assets categorized as Level 3.\n19\n\nUncategorized Investments measured at NAV use the practical expedient and are not\ncategorized within the fair value hierarchy.\nThe following tables set forth, by level within the fair value hierarchy, the Master Trust\u2019s\ninvestment assets, including those of the 401(h) account, at fair value by major category as of\nDecember 31, 2024 and 2023. Investment assets are classified in their entirety based on the lowest\nlevel of input that is significant to the fair value measurement.\nFair Value Measurements (1) as of December 31, 2024\n(Thousands of Dollars) Level 1 Level 2 Uncategorized Total\nEquity Securities $ 331,316 $ - $ 845,639 $ 1,176,955\nFixed Income 324,081 353,517 1,365,256 2,042,854\nPrivate Equity - - 1,769,492 1,769,492\nReal Assets 249,539 - 671,834 921,373\nTotal $ 904,936 $ 353,517 $ 4,652,221 $ 5,910,674\nFair Value Measurements (1) as of December 31, 2023\n(Thousands of Dollars) Level 1 Level 2 Uncategorized Total\nEquity Securities $ 371,396 $ - $ 853,019 $ 1,224,415\nFixed Income 359,701 354,061 1,518,075 2,231,837\nPrivate Equity - - 1,684,826 1,684,826\nReal Assets 124,587 - 722,554 847,141\nTotal $ 855,684 $ 354,061 $ 4,778,474 $ 5,988,219\n(1) The fair value measurement assessment does not apply to the additional accounts receivable and\naccounts payable included in the Interest in Master Trust as reported on the Statements of Net\nAssets Available for Benefits (see Note 5, \u201cMaster Trust Account \u2013 Summarized Financial\nInformation\u201d).\nAssets are valued based on observable inputs when available. Certain interest-bearing cash funds,\nequity securities, exchange traded funds, and futures contracts classified in Level 1 in the fair value\nhierarchy are priced based on the closing price on the primary exchange as of the balance sheet\ndate.\nFixed income securities, such as government issued securities, corporate bonds and high yield\nbond funds, are included in Level 2 and are valued using pricing models, quoted prices of securities\nwith similar characteristics or discounted cash flows. Pricing models utilize observable inputs\nsuch as recent trades for the same or similar instruments, yield curves, discount margins and bond\nstructures. Swaps are valued using pricing models that incorporate interest rates and equity and\nfixed income index closing prices to determine a net present value of cash flows.\n20\n\nCertain investments, such as equity securities and fixed income investments in commingled funds,\nprivate equity and private debt investments, real asset funds and hedge funds are valued using the\nNAV as a practical expedient. These investments are structured as investment companies offering\nshares or units to multiple investors for the purpose of providing a return. Commingled funds are\nrecorded at NAV provided by the asset manager, which is based on the market prices of the\nunderlying equity securities. Hedge Funds are recorded at NAV based on the values of the\nunderlying assets held in hedge funds. Private Equity investments, Fixed Income partnership funds\nand Real Assets are valued using the NAV provided by the partnerships, which are based on\ndiscounted cash flows of the underlying investments, real estate appraisals or public market\ncomparables of the underlying investments. These assets are classified as Uncategorized within\nthe fair value hierarchy in the tables above, as assets valued using the NAV practical expedient are\nnot required to be classified within the fair value hierarchy.\nCertain private equity, credit opportunity and real asset limited partnerships have long-term lock-\nup provisions (5 to 10 years) that are intended to allow for an orderly investment and dissolution\nof the partnership as the underlying investments are sold. The Plan has invested in a variety of\nhedge funds and limited partnerships that have elected to institute monthly, quarterly or annual\nrestraints on redemptions as of December 31, 2024 and 2023.\nThe following tables are a summary of the Plan\u2019s uncategorized investments and related\nrestrictions as of December 31, 2024 and 2023.\nDecember 31, 2024\nUnfunded Redemption Redemption\nFair Value Commitments Frequency Notice Period\n(Thousands of Dollars)\nEquity Securities (1) $ 845,639 N/A Daily to Annual 1-60 Days\nFixed Income (2) 1,365,256 415,754 Daily to Quarterly 0-90 Days\nPrivate Equity (3) 1,769,492 313,186 N/A N/A\nReal Assets (4) 671,834 283,929 Daily 0-5 Days\nDecember 31, 2023\nUnfunded Redemption Redemption\nFair Value Commitments Frequency Notice Period\n(Thousands of Dollars)\nEquity Securities (1) $ 853,019 N/A Daily to Annual 1-60 Days\nFixed Income (2) 1,518,075 444,572 Daily to Quarterly 0-90 Days\nPrivate Equity (3) 1,684,826 306,491 N/A N/A\nReal Assets (4) 722,554 274,189 Daily 0-5 Days\n(1) This category invests in equity security investments including commingled funds and hedge\nfunds that are overlayed with equity index swaps, futures contracts, and funds invested in\nequities that have redemption restrictions and are valued using NAV.\n21\n\n(2) This category consists of funds valued at NAV that invest opportunistically in fixed income\nsecurities where pricing dislocations exist as the result of illiquidity in the markets or due to\ndistressed sellers. These partnerships invest for terms of five to seven years on average and are\ngenerally illiquid. The fair value of these funds is determined using public market comparables\nor the use of pricing models where public comparables are not available. This category also\nincludes hedge funds that are overlayed with US Treasury swaps.\n(3) This category includes several private equity partnerships that have equity ownership in\nunderlying portfolio companies. These partnerships invest for terms of 10 years on average\nand are generally illiquid. The fair value of these funds has been determined using the NAV\nof the ownership interest in the funds, whose underlying investments are based on discounted\ncash flow methodologies and using comparable public market multiples.\n(4) This category consists of real asset partnerships that invest primarily in U.S. residential and\ncommercial properties. These partnerships invest for terms of 10 years on average and are\ngenerally illiquid. The fair value of these funds has been determined using the NAV of the\nownership of the partnerships, whose underlying investments are based on discounted cash\nflows and appraisals of underlying assets.\n8. Exempt Party-in-Interest and Related Parties\nCertain Plan investments are shares of common/collective trusts managed by the trustee; therefore,\nthese transactions qualify as exempt party-in-interest transactions as defined in Section 3(14) of\nERISA.\n9. Risks and Uncertainties\nThe Plan\u2019s assets can be invested in various securities, including fixed income investments, United\nStates government securities, corporate debt instruments, corporate stocks, mutual funds, unit\ninvestment trust securities, partnership/joint ventures and guaranteed insurance contracts.\nInvestment securities, in general, are exposed to various risks, such as interest rate risk, credit risk,\nand overall market volatility. The Plan invests in securities with contractual cash flows, such as\nasset-backed securities, collateralized mortgage obligations and commercial mortgage-backed\nsecurities. The value, liquidity and related income of these securities are sensitive to changes in\neconomic conditions, including real estate value, delinquencies or defaults, or both, and may be\nadversely affected by shifts in the market\u2019s perception of the issuers and changes in interest rate.\nDue to the level of risk associated with certain investment securities, it is reasonably possible that\nchanges in the values of investment securities will occur in the near term and that such changes\ncould materially affect the amounts reported in the financial statements.\nThe methods used to measure fair value may produce an amount that may not be indicative of net\nrealizable value or reflective of future fair values. Furthermore, although the Plan believes its\nvaluation methods are appropriate and consistent with other market participants, the use of\ndifferent methodologies or assumptions to determine the fair value of certain financial instruments\ncould result in a different fair value measurement at the reporting date.\n22\n\nPlan contributions are made, and the actuarial present value of accumulated plan benefits are\nreported, based on certain assumptions pertaining to interest rates, inflation rates and employee\ndemographics, all of which are subject to change. Due to uncertainties inherent in the estimations\nand assumptions process, it is at least reasonably possible that changes in these estimates and\nassumptions in the near-term would be material to the financial statements.\n10.

The financial statements comprise the statements of net assets available for benefits as of\nDecember 31, 2024 and 2023, and the related statement of changes in net assets available for\nbenefits for the year ended December 31, 2024, and the related notes to the financial statements.\nManagement, having determined it is permissible in the circumstances, has elected to have the\naudits of the Plan\u2019s financial statements performed in accordance with ERISA Section\n103(a)(3)(C) pursuant to 29 CFR 2520.103-8 of the Department of Labor\u2019s Rules and Regulations\nfor Reporting and Disclosure under ERISA. As permitted by ERISA Section 103(a)(3)(C), our\naudits need not extend to any statements or information related to assets held for investment of the\nplan (investment information) by a bank or similar institution or insurance carrier that is regulated,\nsupervised, and subject to periodic examination by a state or federal agency, provided that the\nstatements or information regarding assets so held are prepared and certified to by the bank or\nsimilar institution or insurance carrier in accordance with 29 CFR 2520.103-5 of the Department\nof Labor\u2019s Rules and Regulations for Reporting and Disclosure under ERISA (qualified\ninstitution).\nManagement has obtained certifications from a qualified institution as of December 31, 2024 and\n2023, and for the year ended December 31, 2024, stating that the certified investment information,\nas described in Notes 5 and 6 to the financial statements, is complete and accurate.\nOpinion\nIn our opinion, based on our audits and on the procedures performed as described in the Auditor\u2019s\nResponsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements section\u2014\n\uf0b7 the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements referred to above, other than those\nagreed to or derived from the certified investment information, are presented fairly, in all\nmaterial respects, in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the\nUnited States of America.\n\uf0b7 the information in the financial statements referred to above related to assets held by and\ncertified to by a qualified institution agrees to, or is derived from, in all material respects,\nthe information prepared and certified by an institution that management determined meets\nthe requirements of ERISA Section 103(a)(3)(C).\nGLASTONBURY \u2022 STAMFORD \u2022 NEW HAVEN \u2022 AVON \u2022 ENFIELD\n1\n\nIndependent Auditor\u2019s Report (continued)\nBasis for Opinion\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United\nStates of America. Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor\u2019s\nResponsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements section of our report. We are required to\nbe independent of the Plan and to meet our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with the\nrelevant ethical requirements relating to our audits. We believe that the audit evidence we have\nobtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our ERISA Section 103(a)(3)(C) audit\nopinion.\nResponsibilities of Management for the Financial Statements\nManagement is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the financial statements in\naccordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, and for\nthe design, implementation, and maintenance of internal control relevant to the preparation and\nfair presentation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to\nfraud or error. Management\u2019s election of the ERISA Section 103(a)(3)(C) audit does not affect\nmanagement's responsibility for the financial statements.\nIn preparing the financial statements, management is required to evaluate whether there are\nconditions or events, considered in the aggregate, that raise substantial doubt about the Plan\u2019s\nability to continue as a going concern for one year after the date the financial statements are\navailable to be issued.\nManagement is also responsible for maintaining a current plan instrument, including all plan\namendments; administering the plan; and determining that the Plan\u2019s transactions that are\npresented and disclosed in the financial statements are in conformity with the plan's provisions,\nincluding maintaining sufficient records with respect to each of the participants, to determine the\nbenefits due or which may become due to such participants.\nAuditor\u2019s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements\nExcept as described in the Scope and Nature of the ERISA Section 103(a)(3)(C) Audit section of\nour report, our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements\nas a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an\nauditor\u2019s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance but is\nnot absolute assurance and therefore is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with\ngenerally accepted auditing standards will always detect a material misstatement when it exists.\nThe risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one\nresulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions,\nmisrepresentations, or the override of internal control. Misstatements are considered material if\nthere is a substantial likelihood that, individually or in the aggregate, they would influence the\njudgment made by a reasonable user based on the financial statements.\nGLASTONBURY \u2022 STAMFORD \u2022 NEW HAVEN \u2022 AVON \u2022 ENFIELD\n2\n\nIndependent Auditor\u2019s Report (continued)\nAuditor\u2019s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements (continued)\nIn performing an audit in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards, we:\n\uf0b7 Exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit.\n\uf0b7 Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether\ndue to fraud or error, and design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks.\nSuch procedures include examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and\ndisclosures in the financial statements.\n\uf0b7 Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit\nprocedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing\nan opinion on the effectiveness of the Plan\u2019s internal control. Accordingly, no such opinion\nis expressed.\n\uf0b7 Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of\nsignificant accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluate the overall\npresentation of the financial statements.\n\uf0b7 Conclude whether, in our judgment, there are conditions or events, considered in the\naggregate, that raise substantial doubt about the Plan\u2019s ability to continue as a going\nconcern for a reasonable period of time.\nOur audits did not extend to the certified investment information, except for obtaining and reading\nthe certification, comparing the certified investment information with the related information\npresented and disclosed in the financial statements, and reading the disclosures relating to the\ncertified investment information to assess whether they are in accordance with the presentation\nand disclosure requirements of accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of\nAmerica.\nAccordingly, the objective of an ERISA Section 103(a)(3)(C) audit is not to express an opinion\nabout whether the financial statements as a whole are presented fairly, in all material respects, in\naccordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\nWe are required to communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other\nmatters, the planned scope and timing of the audit, significant audit findings, and certain internal\ncontrol-related matters that we identified during the audit.\nGLASTONBURY \u2022 STAMFORD \u2022 NEW HAVEN \u2022 AVON \u2022 ENFIELD\n3\n\nIndependent Auditor\u2019s Report (continued)\nSupplemental Schedule Required by ERISA\nThe supplemental Schedule of Assets (Held at End of Year) as of December 31, 2024 is presented\nfor purposes of additional analysis and is not a required part of the financial statements but is\nsupplementary information required by the Department of Labor's Rules and Regulations for\nReporting and Disclosure under ERISA.

Plan Description\nThe following is a brief description of the Eversource Pension Plan (the \u201cPlan\u201d), which is provided\nfor general information purposes only. Participants should refer to the Plan document for a more\ncomplete description of the Plan\u2019s provisions.\nGeneral\nThe Plan is a defined benefit plan that is subject to the provisions of the Employee Retirement\nIncome Security Act of 1974 (\u201cERISA\u201d), as amended. The Plan was established to provide\npension benefits for eligible retirees of Eversource Energy (\u201cEversource\u201d) and participating\ncompanies under the Plan and incidental benefits for surviving spouses, other beneficiaries, and\ncontingent annuitants of the Plan. The Plan is an employer funded defined benefit plan with certain\nparticipant contributory features. Eversource Energy Service Company (\u201cEversource Service\u201d or,\nthe \u201cCompany\u201d), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Eversource, is the Plan sponsor, and participating\ncompanies in the Plan are, among others, The Connecticut Light and Power Company, NSTAR\nElectric Company, Public Service Company of New Hampshire, NSTAR Gas Company,\nEversource Gas Company of Massachusetts and Yankee Gas Services Company, all of which are\nsubsidiaries of Eversource (collectively, the \u201cEmployer\u201d). Effective January 1, 2006, newly hired\nemployees, and bargaining unit employees as subsequently negotiated, receive retirement benefits\nunder the Eversource 401k Plan, rather than under the Eversource Pension Plan.\nThe Plan is administered by the Executive Vice President \u2013 Human Resources and Information\nTechnology of Eversource (the \u201cAdministrator\u201d), who determines eligibility in accordance with\nPlan documents and makes other interpretations under the Plan at her discretion in conjunction\nwith the Eversource Plan Administration Committee. The Eversource Plan Administration\nCommittee is responsible for Plan administrative matters and the Eversource Retirement Plan and\nInvestment Committee is the named fiduciary with responsibility for all matters relating to the\nfunding of the Plan and valuation and oversight of the investment of the Plan assets.\nThe assets of the Plan are held in the Eversource Retirement Plan Master Trust (Master Trust).\nThe Master Trust also holds the assets of the Retirement Plan for Employees of Aquarion Company\n(Aquarion Pension Plan), which transferred to the Master Trust in 2023, and the ES Pension\nOffshore Portfolio Ltd. exempted investment company, which was incorporated in March 2024.\nSee Note 5, \u201cMaster Trust Account \u2013 Summarized Financial Information\u201d for further information\nregarding the ES Pension Offshore Portfolio Ltd exempted investment company. The Master\nTrust's assets are held by the Plan\u2019s trustee, The Bank of New York Mellon (the trustee). The\ntrustee is responsible for the management and control of the Plan\u2019s assets and, subject to various\ninvestment management agreements, has certain discretionary authority and control over such\nassets.\n7\n\nContributions\nContributions represent amounts required to fund the Plan\u2019s current service cost on a current basis\nand to fund past service cost over future years on a straight-line basis. The Company currently\nplans to contribute such amounts as are necessary to provide the Plan with assets sufficient to meet\nthe benefits to be paid to participants, based on the recommendation of the Plan\u2019s actuary.\nContributions are expected to equal or exceed minimum amounts required to be funded under\nprovisions of ERISA, as amended by the Pension Protection Act of 2006, and the Internal Revenue\nCode (\u201cIRC\u201d). Positive return (interest, dividends, and net realized and unrealized gains) on the\ninvestments of the Plan serves to reduce future contributions that would otherwise be required to\nprovide for the defined level of benefits. The Company did not make any contributions applicable\nto the 2024 Plan year.\nCash Balance Pension Plan: In 2024, Eversource communicated to its employees participating in\nthe Eversource 401k Plan\u2019s enhanced defined contribution feature (referred to as K-Vantage) that\neffective January 1, 2025, a Cash Balance Pension Plan is established, which replaces future\nemployer non-elective K-Vantage contributions. Effective January 1, 2025, Eversource\ntransferred non-represented and represented K-Vantage employees, as negotiated, into the Cash\nBalance Pension Plan (with the exception of one union group that voted to enter the Cash Balance\nPension Plan effective January 1, 2026), and will provide participants with annual pay credits as\nof each December 31st as a set percentage of an employee\u2019s eligible pay, ranging from 3.5 percent\nto six percent, based on age and years of service on the employee\u2019s behalf and an annual interest\ncredit on the prior year\u2019s account balance. The interest credit is based on the participant\u2019s cash\nbalance account as of the preceding December 31 to the Plan year and is equal to the interest rate\nfor 30-year U.S. Treasuries as published by the IRS for the month of September immediately\npreceding the first day of the Plan year, but as a minimum will not be less than 4 percent for any\nPlan year. This benefit is a new, additional obligation of the existing Plan and will be funded\nthrough the existing assets of the Plan.\nFor active eligible K-Vantage employees that were not vested in K-Vantage prior to migrating to\nthe Eversource Cash Balance Pension Plan on January 1, 2025, their prior K-Vantage accrued\nservice will subsequently carry forward to the Eversource Cash Balance Pension Plan, with vesting\nin both K-Vantage and in the Eversource Cash Balance Pension Plan occurring in the aggregate.\nEffective January 1, 2025, no additional K-Vantage contributions are made to the Eversource 401k\nPlan (with the exception of the same one union that will adopt the Eversource Cash Balance\nPension Plan as a replacement for K-Vantage effective January 1, 2026).\nVesting\nDepending on provisions of the Plan document, Pension Plan participants vest in accrued benefits\nafter completing either three or five years of credited service with the Company.\nBeginning January 1, 2025, participants in the Cash Balance Pension Plan will be fully vested in\naccrued benefits upon the completion of three years of credited service with the Company.\n8\n\nRetirement Benefits\nRetirees are entitled to annual benefits based on the benefit formulas in accordance with provisions\nof Plan documents. Normal retirement age is 65, and in accordance with Plan provisions, eligible\nparticipants may retire prior to 65 if certain conditions are met. Depending on Plan provisions,\nsome eligible participants may have the option to receive benefit payments in either the form of a\nlump-sum or variety of annuity options.\n401(h) Account\nThe Plan includes a medical-benefit component, in addition to the normal retirement benefits, to\nfund a portion of the Plan\u2019s obligations for retirees and their beneficiaries in accordance with\nSection 401(h) of the IRC. A separate account is maintained by the Plan for the net assets related\nto the medical-benefit component (\u201c401(h) account\u201d). In accordance with IRC Section 401(h), the\nPlan\u2019s investments in the 401(h) account may not be used for, or diverted to, any purpose other\nthan providing health benefits for retirees and their beneficiaries. Any assets transferred to the\n401(h) account from the Plan in a qualified transfer of excess Plan assets (and any income allocable\nthereto) that are not used during the Plan year must be transferred out of the account to the Plan.\nThe related obligations for health benefits are not included in this Plan\u2019s obligations in the table\nof accumulated plan benefits (see Note 4, \u201cActuarial Present Value of Accumulated Plan\nBenefits\u201d), but are reflected as obligations in the financial statements of the Eversource Group\nHealth and Welfare Retiree Benefit Plan. Plan participants do not contribute to the 401(h) account.\nEmployer contributions or qualified transfers to the 401(h) account are determined annually and\nare at the discretion of the Company. There were no contributions or transfers to the 401(h) account\nduring 2024.\nThe following table presents the fair value of the Plan\u2019s investments in the 401(h) account as of\nDecember 31, 2024 and 2023:\n(Thousands of Dollars) 2024 2023\nInvestments:\nInterest in Master Trust $ 231,683 $ 244,786\nGuaranteed Insurance Contracts 109 113\nTotal Investments $ 231,792 $ 244,899\nThe following table presents the changes in net assets available for benefits in the 401(h) account\nfor the year ended December 31, 2024:\n(Thousands of Dollars) 2024\nNet Appreciation in Fair Value of Interest in Master Trust $ 10,819\nClaims Paid (23,348)\nAdministrative Expenses, Net of Reimbursements (578)\nNet Decrease $ (13,107)\n9\n\n2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\nMethod of Accounting\nThe financial statements have been prepared on the accrual basis of accounting in accordance with\naccounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (\u201cGAAP\u201d).\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make\nestimates and assumptions that affect certain reported amounts and disclosures in the financial\nstatements. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\nValuation of Investments and Income Recognition\nThe fair value of the interest in the Master Trust is based on the fair value of the underlying assets\nheld by the Master Trust. The investments held by the Master Trust are reported at fair value (see\nNote 7, \u201cFair Value Measurements\u201d). The Plan applies ASC 820, Fair Value Measurement and\nDisclosures (ASC 820), which defines fair value, establishes a fair value hierarchy, and includes\ndisclosures about fair value measurements. The fair value of a financial instrument is the amount\nthat would be received upon the sale of an asset (or paid upon the transfer of a liability) in an\norderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date (the exit price) and in the\nprincipal or most advantageous market for that asset or liability. The fair values of the assets in\nthe Master Trust and those held directly by the Plan are accounted for as described below:\nCorporate stocks are traded in active markets on national and international securities exchanges\nand are valued at closing prices on the primary exchange on the last business day of each period\npresented.\nCorporate debt instruments and U.S. government securities are generally valued using pricing\nmodels, quoted prices of securities with similar characteristics or discounted cash flows. The\npricing models utilize observable inputs such as recent trades for the same or similar instruments,\nyield curves, discount margins and bond structures. Securities that trade infrequently and\ntherefore, have little or no price transparency, are valued using the investment manager\u2019s best\nestimates.\nCommon collective trusts, 103-12 investment entities and registered investment companies\nrepresent investments with various investment managers. The respective fair values of these\ninvestments are determined by reference to the funds\u2019 underlying assets, which are primarily\nmarketable equity securities. Units held in common collective trusts and 103-12 investment\nentities, and shares held in registered investment companies are valued using the net asset value\n(\u201cNAV\u201d) or unit value as reported by the investment managers.\n10\n\nPartnership investments represent ownership interests in alternative investments. The fair value\nof these investments is determined by reference to various underlying assets, which include, among\nother things, real estate properties, private companies, fixed income securities and marketable\nequity securities. The value of interests is determined by the general partner, based upon third-\nparty appraisals of underlying real estate assets and various methods for other assets, such as\ndiscounted cash flows and independent valuations.\nCash includes interest bearing and non-interest bearing cash and are valued at cost, which\napproximates fair value. Cash also includes collateral held by the broker.\nThe Plan\u2019s investment policy allows for the use of derivatives by investment managers of the\nMaster Trust to hedge interest rate or currency risk, reduce transaction costs, enhance returns, and\nfacilitate shifts in asset allocation. Swaps, futures, forwards and options are entered into as part of\nthe Plan\u2019s investment strategy.\nSwaps are valued using pricing models that incorporate interest rates and equity and fixed income\nindex closing prices to determine a net present value of the cash flows. A swap transaction\ninvolves the exchange of cash flows between two counterparties. One party receives the total\nreturn of a specified index or instrument while the other party receives a fixed or floating interest\nrate. Swaps are marked-to-market daily based on changes in the underlying asset or index\nvaluation or changes in interest rates, and any gains or losses are covered by cash or other\ncollateral. The net difference between the two receipts is exchanged at a predetermined settlement\ndate.\nFutures contracts represent a commitment for the future purchase or sale of an asset or index at a\nspecified price on a specified date and are marked-to-market based on the closing exchange prices\nand settled in cash daily.\nForward currency contracts are marked-to-market at the prevailing forward exchange rate of the\nunderlying currencies.\nAn option contract provides the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell specified amounts of a\nfinancial instrument, commodity, or currency at a contracted price during a specified period or on\na specified date. Options that are listed on a national securities exchange are valued at their last\nreported price. Options traded in the OTC markets are valued using the midpoint between the last\nreported bid and ask prices.\nThese various derivative instruments are included in other investments in Note 5, \u201cMaster Trust\nAccount - Summarized Financial Information.\u201d The unrealized gain or loss on derivative\ninstruments is recorded as unrealized appreciation (depreciation) in the Plan net assets.\nThe Plan\u2019s investment strategy includes a liability matching program, which seeks to reduce\nfunded status volatility by more closely aligning the duration of assets with the duration of\nprojected pension liabilities. The Plan utilizes US Treasury STRIPS, investment grade corporate\nbonds, treasury swaps and futures with the goal of matching the approximately 50 percent change\nin the Plan\u2019s liabilities for a given change in interest rates. The swaps and futures contracts used\nin the implementation of the liability matching strategy are accounted for as derivatives and\nreported at fair market value.\n11\n\nContracts with insurance companies (immediate participation guarantee contracts) are carried at\ncontract value, which represents contributions made under the contracts, plus interest at the\ncontract rates, less benefit payments and administrative expenses charged by the carriers. The\ncontract value of the unallocated contracts with insurance companies approximates fair value.\nThese investments are not included in the Master Trust.\nPurchases and sales of securities are recorded on the trade date, and dividend income is recorded\non the ex-dividend date. Income from other investments is recorded as earned. Net appreciation\nor depreciation in the fair value of investments consists of the realized and unrealized gains or\nlosses on those investments.\nIn the Statement of Changes in Net Assets Available for Benefits, the Plan presents the net\nappreciation or depreciation in the fair value of its interest in the Master Trust, which consists of\nrealized gains and losses and the unrealized appreciation and depreciation on those investments.\nAdministrative Expenses\nExpenses incurred in the administration of the Plan are paid by the Plan, unless the Administrator\nor the funding fiduciary, whichever is appropriate, elects to have such expenses paid for by the\nPlan Sponsor. Administrative expenses in the Statement of Changes in Net Assets Available for\nBenefits include Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (\u201cPBGC\u201d) fees, trustee, legal, actuarial,\nand audit fees. Investment management fees paid by the Master Trust are included in net\nappreciation or depreciation in fair value of the Plan\u2019s interest in the Master Trust in the\nStatement of Changes in Net Assets Available for Benefits.\nPayment of Benefits\nBenefit payments to participants are recorded upon distribution. The Plan had no participant\nbenefits payable as of both December 31, 2024 and 2023.\nTermination Provisions\nThe Company may suspend, terminate or completely discontinue contributions under the Plan with\nrespect to its participants, subject to the requirement that the Administrator shall comply with\nPBGC filing requirements for Plan terminations and with all other provisions of ERISA or the\nPBGC relating to Plan terminations. The Company currently has no intention of terminating the\nPlan.\nUpon termination or partial termination of the Plan, the rights of all affected participants to their\nbasic retirement amounts to the date of such termination become fully vested to the extent funded.\nIn the event of such termination, affected participants have recourse towards satisfaction of basic\nretirement amounts from assets of the Plan or from the PBGC to the extent it guarantees Plan\nbenefits.\n12\n\nIn the event that the Plan is terminated or contributions permanently discontinued, the then present\nvalue of benefits vested in each participant would be determined as of the Plan termination date,\nand the assets of any fund then held by the trustee or insurance company as reserves for retirement\nbenefits for participants under the Plan would be allocated, to the extent sufficient after providing\nfor administrative expenses, to meet Plan obligations in the following order of precedence:\na. Accrued benefits, which are derived from a participant\u2019s own contributions held under\nthe Plan;\nb. Benefits of individuals, which were in pay status as of the beginning of the three-year\nperiod ending on the termination date of the Plan, based on the provisions of the Plan\nas in effect during the five-year period ending on such date under which such benefit\nwould be the least;\nc. Benefits of individuals, which would have been in pay status as of the beginning of the\nthree-year period ending on the termination date of the Plan if the participant had retired\nprior to the beginning of such three-year period and if payment of such benefit had\ncommenced (in the normal form of annuity under the Plan) as of the beginning of such\nperiod, based on the provisions of the Plan as in effect during the five-year period\nending on such date under which such benefit would be the least;\nd. All other benefits (if any) of individuals under the Plan guaranteed by the PBGC under\nTitle IV of ERISA;\ne. All other vested benefits under the Plan; and\nf. all other accrued benefits under the Plan.\nIf the assets of the fund held by the trustee or insurance company as reserves for retirement income\nfor participants of the Plan, as of the date of the Plan termination, are not sufficient to provide, in\nwhole, the amounts required within the classes described above, such assets will be allocated pro-\nrata within the class in which the amounts first cannot be provided in full. Allocation in any of the\nabove-listed categories would be adjusted for any allocation already made to the same participant\nunder a prior category. Allocation of assets may be modified by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS)\nto meet nondiscrimination requirements. After all liabilities of the Plan have been satisfied, the\nCompany would be entitled to any balance of the fund that remained.\n3. Tax Status\nThe IRS previously determined and informed the Company, by a letter dated February 4, 2016,\nthat the Plan was designed in accordance with applicable sections of the IRC. The Plan received\nan updated letter dated April 19, 2021 which stated that the Plan remained in accordance with\napplicable sections of the IRC. Although the Plan has been amended since receiving the opinion\nletter, the Plan administrator and the Plan\u2019s tax counsel believe that the Plan is designed, and is\ncurrently being operated, in compliance with the applicable requirements of the IRC and, therefore,\nbelieve that the Plan is qualified, and the related trust is tax-exempt. No provision for income\ntaxes has been included in the Plan\u2019s financial statements.\n13",
