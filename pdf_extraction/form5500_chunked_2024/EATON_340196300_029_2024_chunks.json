No information or analysis is needed for any assumption prescribed by law or regulation.\nThe interest rates and mortality assumption used for this measurement are prescribed by law.\nThe economic assumption that has a significant effect on the measurement and that the actuary has selected is\nthe expected rate of return on assets. An analysis using the Gallagher General Economy and Market Simulator\n(GEMS) Model is used to set the expected rate of return on plan assets.\nDemographic and other non-economic assumptions that have a significant effect on the measurement are\nannuitant mortality, annuitant mortality improvement, retirement rates, withdrawal rates and frequency of optional\npayment forms. The assumptions for non-annuitant mortality and non-annuitant future mortality improvement are\nprescribed by law. The assumptions for annuitant mortality, annuitant mortality improvement, retirement rates,\nwithdrawal rates and frequency of optional payment forms were selected by the enrolled actuary and are\nreasonable given historic gain and loss experience of the plan. The actuary has determined that these\nassumptions do not significantly conflict with what, in the actuary\u2019s professional judgment, are reasonable for the\npurpose of the measurement. The rates are monitored annually with updates made as deemed necessary.\nFor assumptions that apply to the former Cobham Orchard Park Defined Benefit Plan participants, the current\nassumptions were set by the prior actuary. We believe the current assumptions to be reasonable.\nUse of Models\nActuarial Standard of Practice No. 56 (\u201cASOP 56\u201d) provides guidance to actuaries when performing actuarial\nservices that involve designing, developing, selecting, modifying, using, reviewing, or evaluating models.\nGallagher used third-party software to perform the calculations that underlie the actuarial information contained in\nthis report. The model in the third-party software calculated the actuarial information provided in this report using\nplan provisions, data, and assumptions as of a measurement date under rules applicable to the calculations.\nGallagher has an extensive review process whereby the results of the calculations are checked using detailed\nsample output, changes from year to year are summarized by source, and significant deviations from\nexpectations are investigated. Other outputs are similarly reviewed in detail and at a high level for accuracy,\nreasonability, and consistency with prior results. Gallagher also reviews the model when software changes occur.\nThe review is performed by experts who are familiar with applicable rules and the way the model generates its\noutput.\nFuture actuarial measurements\nFuture actuarial measurements may differ significantly from current measurements due to plan experience\ndiffering from that anticipated by the actuarial assumptions, changes expected as part of the natural operation of\nthe methodology used for these measurements, and changes in plan provisions, applicable law or regulations. An\nanalysis of the potential range of such future differences is beyond the scope of this report.\n\nPension Plan for Eaton Corporation Employees\nEIN/PN: 34-0196300 / 029\nSchedule SB, Part V \u2013 Statement of Actuarial Assumptions/Methods (continued)\nPrescribed Funding Assumptions and Methods\nThe following assumptions and methods are prescribed by ERISA.\nInterest rates\nFor 2024 Plan Year: Full Yield Curve as of January 1, 2024\nEffective Interest Rate: 5.13%\nFor 2023 Plan Year: Full Yield Curve as of January 1, 2023\nEffective Interest Rate: 5.06%\nEaton and Cooper Pension Plan Mortality\nNon-disabled\nEaton specific mortality projected with MP-2021 Improvement Scale published by the Society of Actuaries\n(SOA) from the base year of 2015 for annuitants and mortality tables mandated by applicable law and\nregulation as specified in IRS Regulation 1.430(h)(3)-1, as amended in the Federal Register on October 20,\n2023, in TD 9983, 88 FR 72357, applied on a fully generational basis using the IRS 2024 Adjusted Scale MP-\n2021 Rates mortality improvement scale for non-annuitants.\nDisabled\nRevenue Ruling 96-7 disabled mortality for males and females.\nCobham Orchard Park Defined Benefit Plan Mortality\nMortality tables mandated by applicable law and regulation as specified in IRS Regulation 1.430(h)(3)-1, as\namended in the Federal Register on October 20, 2023, in TD 9983, 88 FR 72357, applied on a fully generational\nbasis using the IRS 2024 Adjusted Scale MP-2021 Rates mortality improvement scale.\nMortality for purposes of calculating lump sums\nFor Eaton, lump sum mortality is based on the 2024 IRS 417(e) Applicable Mortality table, as amended by IRS\nNotice 2023-73. For Cooper Pension Plan and Cobham Orchard Park Defined Benefit Plan, lump sum mortality is\nnot applicable.\nActuarial cost method\nThe Funding Target is the present value of accrued benefits based on compensation and service to date. The\nTarget Normal Cost is the present value of benefits expected to be accrued during the current plan year, reflecting\nthe effect of expected compensation increases during the year and including plan-related expenses expected to\nbe paid from plan assets during the year.\n\nPension Plan for Eaton Corporation Employees\nEIN/PN: 34-0196300 / 029\nSchedule SB, Part V \u2013 Statement of Actuarial Assumptions/Methods (continued)\nNon-Prescribed Funding Assumptions and Methods\nFor Eaton the following assumptions were selected by the plan\u2019s enrolled actuary. The asset valuation method\nwas selected by the plan sponsor with the actuary\u2019s advice and is an acceptable method under PPA.\nFor assumptions that apply to former Cooper Pension Plan participants, the current assumptions were set based\non an experience study performed in 2022.\nFor assumptions that apply to former Cobham Orchard Park Defined Benefit Plan participants, the current\nassumptions were set by the prior actuary. We believe the current assumptions to be reasonable.\nPlan Expenses\nExpected plan related expenses are equal to a 5-year average of expenses paid from the Plan outside of PBGC\npremiums, adjusted for inflation, plus the estimated PBGC premiums for the current year rounded up to the\nnearest thousand. For 2024 the estimated plan related expenses included in the Target Normal Cost are\n$24,610,000.\nSalary increase assumption\nFor Eaton wages and salaries are assumed to increase by 4.00% per annum for 2024 and 3.00% after 2024. This\nassumption is based on guidance from Eaton Corporation\u2019s expectations for the coming years.\nInflation\nFor Eaton the annual inflation increase is 2.75%. This assumption is based on 25-year historical data excluding\nthe period after the 2008 financial crisis but including expected future inflation.\nSocial Security\nFor Eaton the annual increase in maximum wage base is 2.75%. This assumption is based on the expected\ninflation assumption.\nCash Balance interest crediting rate\nThe interest crediting rate for Appendix CB is assumed to be equal to the forward rates for 30-Year Treasury\nSecurities as published by Bloomberg as of December 31, 2023. The interest crediting rate for Appendix ASD is\nassumed to be equal to the forward rates for 5-Year Treasury Securities as published by Bloomberg as of\nDecember 31, 2023. The interest crediting rate applicable to cash balance accounts of former Cooper Pension\nPlan participants is assumed to be equal to the forward rates for 1-Year Treasury Securities as published by\nBloomberg as of December 31, 2023.\nCash balance index credits\nFor opening account balances subject to indexing under Appendix CB are assumed to increase 2.75% per annum\n(in addition to interest credits) during active employment. This is assumed to be the same as inflation, which is in\nline with the basis for actual index credits to participant accounts as outlined in the plan document.\nCash Balance Annuity Conversion Rate\nConversion of cash balance accounts to annuity forms of payment for former Cooper Pension Plan participants is\nbased on the following assumptions:\nInterest \u2013 3.25% for 2024 and 2.75% for 2023.\nMortality \u2013 Blended 1971 Group Annuity Mortality projected to 1978 with Scale E (95% male/5% female).\n\nPension Plan for Eaton Corporation Employees\nEIN/PN: 34-0196300 / 029\nSchedule SB, Part V \u2013 Statement of Actuarial Assumptions/Methods (continued)\nNon-Prescribed Funding Assumptions and Methods (continued)\nCost of Living Adjustment\nFor Eaton the cost of living increase is assumed to be 2.75%, when applicable. This is assumed to be the same\nas inflation, which is in line with the basis for actual cost of living adjustments to participant benefits as outlined in\nthe plan document.\nMarital Percentage\nIt was assumed that 82.5% of the male salaried employees and 61.5% of the female salaried employees would\nbe married at the time of retirement. For former Cooper Pension Plan participants, it was assumed that 80% of all\nparticipants are married and that husbands are 3 years older than their wives. For former Cobham Orchard Park\nDefined Benefit Plan participants, it was assumed that 75% of the male participants and 65% of the female\nparticipants are married and that husbands are 4 years older than their wives. For all other participants, 85% of\nthe male and 65% of the female are assumed to be married. In each case the husband was assumed to be 3\nyears older than his wife.\nFrequency of optional payment forms and assumed commencement ages\n80% of cash balance participants are assumed to elect the lump sum option while 20% are assumed to take the\nannuity option. Of others who are eligible, 60% are assumed to elect the lump sum form of benefit payment. Other\noptional forms of payment were assumed based on the experience of each appendix over the last several years.\nOptional form elections are summarized in the tables below for actives and deferred vested participants.\nDeferred vested participants are assumed to commence benefits at age 62, if they are eligible for unreduced\nretirement. Otherwise, the assumed commencement age is 65. Assumed commencement ages for active\nparticipants vary based on the provisions of the applicable appendix. Active commencement ages are\nsummarized in the chart below.\nThe commencement assumption for terminating Appendix CB participants is 50% immediate commencement and\n50% deferred to age 62 commencement. For terminating Appendix CB participants over age 62, 100% immediate\ncommencement will be assumed. The commencement assumption for Appendix CB participants who are\nassumed to become disabled is 75% immediate commencement and 25% deferred until normal retirement date.\nWith respect to former Cooper Pension Plan participants, 15% of those with cash balance accounts are assumed\nto receive their benefit in the form of a single life annuity, 7.5% are assumed to receive a 50% joint and survivor\nannuity, 7.5% are assumed to receive a 100% joint and survivor annuity, and 70% are assumed to receive their\nbenefit in the form of a lump sum. Deferred vested participants with traditional deferred annuities are assumed to\nreceive their benefits in the form of a single life annuity. All future terminations with lump sum values under $15,000\nare assumed 100% to take an immediate lump sum.\nWith respect to former Cobham Orchard Park Defined Benefit Plan participants, 100% are assumed to receive their\nbenefit in the form of a single life annuity.\n\nPension Plan for Eaton Corporation Employees\nEIN/PN: 34-0196300 / 029\nSchedule SB, Part V \u2013 Statement of Actuarial Assumptions/Methods (continued)\nNon-Prescribed Funding Assumptions and Methods (continued)\nEaton\nAssumed Optional Forms for Active Participants\n50% 55% 60% 67% 75% 100% 5 Year 10 Year 15 Year Assumed\nLife Joint & Joint & Joint & Joint & Joint & Joint & Certain Certain Certain Lump Deferral\nPlan Annuity Survivor Survivor Survivor Survivor Survivor Survivor & Life & Life & Life Sum Age\nAppendix A 27% 7% 6% 60% 60\nAppendix B 30% 5% 5% 60% 62/63\nAppendix D 19% 21% 60% 63\nAppendix ASD 18% 1% 1% 80% Varies\nAppendix CB 18% 1% 1% 80% Varies\nArgo-Tech Hourly 58% 8% 1% 33% 65\nArgo-Tech Salaried 60% 11% 3% 26% 65\nAJ Hourly 44% 56% 62\nCC Hourly 100% 55\nCH Hourly 64% 13% 23% 63\nCH Hourly (Beaver\n34% 2% 4% 60%\n/ Horseheads) 65\nCL Hourly 46% 41% 11% 2% 63\nCO Hourly 23% 77% 55\nFW Hourly 41% 32% 18% 9% 63\nHU Hourly 60% 40% 64\nRX Hourly 31% 7% 2% 60% 63\nStanley Aviation 11% 29% 60% 65\nVJ Hourly 29% 41% 3% 5% 22% 65\nW Hourly 77% 20% 3% 63\nWR Hourly1 25% 25% 50% 63\n1 For 2026 and beyond, optional form probabilities will be the following: Life Annuity 12.5%, 50% Joint & Survivor 12.5%, 55% Joint & Survivor\n25%, and Lump Sum 50%.\n\nPension Plan for Eaton Corporation Employees\nEIN/PN: 34-0196300 / 029\nSchedule SB, Part V \u2013 Statement of Actuarial Assumptions/Methods (continued)\nNon-Prescribed Funding Assumptions and Methods (continued)\nEaton (continued)\nAssumed Optional Forms for Deferred Vested Participants\n33% 50% 55% 60% 67% 75% 100% 5 Year 10 Year 15 Year 20 Year\nLife Joint & Joint & Joint & Joint & Joint & Joint & Joint & Certain Certain Certain Certain Lump\nPlan Annuity Survivor Survivor Survivor Survivor Survivor Survivor Survivor & Life & Life & Life & Life Sum\nAppendix A 23% 6% 7% 5% 59%\nAppendix B 13% 5% 2% 5% 75%\nAppendix D 19% 21% 60%\nAppendix ASD 18% 1% 1% 80%\nAppendix CB 18% 1% 1% 80%\nAJ Hourly 44% 56%\nArgo-Tech Hourly 58% 8% 1% 33%\nArgo-Tech Salaried 60% 11% 3% 26%\nCC Hourly 100%\nCCA Salaried 11% 33% 56%\nCCC 13% 25% 13% 49%\nCH Hourly 73% 19% 5% 3%\nCH (Beaver /\nHorseheads) 8% 2% 4% 86%\nChallenger (Chr.)\nFormer Hrly 79% 13% 8%\nChr.

The financial\nstatements comprise the statement of net assets available for benefits as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, and\nthe related statement of changes in net assets available for benefits for the years then ended, and the related\nnotes to the financial statements.\nManagement, having determined it is permissible in the circumstances, has elected to have the audit of the\nPlan\u2019s financial statements performed in accordance with ERISA Section 103(a)(3)(C) pursuant to 29 CFR\n2520.103-8 of the Department of Labor\u2019s Rules and Regulations for Reporting and Disclosure under ERISA.\nAs permitted by ERISA Section 103(a)(3)(C), our audit need not extend to any statements or information\nrelated to assets held for investment of the plan (investment information) by a bank or similar institution or\ninsurance carrier that is regulated, supervised, and subject to periodic examination by a state or federal agency,\nprovided that the statements or information regarding assets so held are prepared and certified to by the bank\nor similar institution or insurance carrier in accordance with 29 CFR 2520.103-5 of the Department of Labor\u2019s\nRules and Regulations for Reporting and Disclosure under ERISA (qualified institution).\nManagement has obtained certifications from qualified institutions, The Bank of New York Mellon/BNY\nMellon, N.A. and State Street Bank and Trust Company, as of and for the years ended December 31, 2024 and\n2023, stating that the certified investment information, as described in Note 3 to the financial statements, is\ncomplete and accurate.\nOpinion\nIn our opinion, based on our audit and on the procedures performed as described in the Auditor\u2019s\nResponsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements section:\n\u2022 the amounts and disclosures in the accompanying financial statements, other than those agreed to or\nderived from the certified investment information, are presented fairly, in all material respects, in\naccordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\n\u2022 the information in the accompanying financial statements related to assets held by and certified to by a\nqualified institution agrees to, or is derived from, in all material respects, the information prepared and\ncertified by an institution that management determined meets the requirements of ERISA Section\n103(a)(3)(C).\nBasis for Opinion\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of\nAmerica (GAAS). Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor\u2019s\nResponsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements section of our report. We are required to be\nindependent of the Plan and to meet our other ethical responsibilities, in accordance with the relevant ethical\nrequirements relating to our audits. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and\nappropriate to provide a basis for our ERISA Section 103(a)(3)(C) audit opinion.\nMeaden & Moore, Ltd.\n(A Meaden & Moore Affiliate Company)\n1375 East Ninth Street, Suite 1800 | Cleveland, OH 44114-1790 | P (216) 241-3272 | F (216) 771-4511 | meadenmoore.com\n\nResponsibilities of Management for the Financial Statements\nManagement is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the financial statements in accordance\nwith accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, and for the design,\nimplementation, and maintenance of internal control relevant to the preparation and fair presentation of\nfinancial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. Management\u2019s\nelection of the ERISA Section 103(a)(3)(C) audit does not affect management\u2019s responsibility for the financial\nstatements.\nIn preparing the financial statements, management is required to evaluate whether there are conditions or\nevents, considered in the aggregate, that raise substantial doubt about the Plan\u2019s ability to continue as a going\nconcern for one year after the date that the financial statements are issued.\nManagement is also responsible for maintaining a current plan instrument, including all plan amendments,\nadministering the plan, and determining that the plan\u2019s transactions that are presented and disclosed in the\nfinancial statements are in conformity with the plan\u2019s provisions, including maintaining sufficient records with\nrespect to each of the participants, to determine the benefits due or which may become due to such\nparticipants.\nAuditor\u2019s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements\nExcept as described in the Scope and Nature of the ERISA Section 103(a)(3)(C) Audit section of our report,\nour objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free\nfrom material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor\u2019s report that includes our\nopinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance but is not absolute assurance and therefore is not a\nguarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with GAAS will always detect a material misstatement when\nit exists. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting\nfrom error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override\nof internal control. Misstatements are considered material if there is a substantial likelihood that, individually\nor in the aggregate, they would influence the judgment made by a reasonable user based on the financial\nstatements.\nIn performing an audit in accordance with GAAS, we:\n\u2022 Exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit.\n\u2022 Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or\nerror, and design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks. Such procedures include\nexamining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.\n\u2022 Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that\nare appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness\nof the Plan\u2019s internal control. Accordingly, no such opinion is expressed.\n\u2022 Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of significant accounting\nestimates made by management, as well as evaluate the overall presentation of the financial statements.\n\u2022 Conclude whether, in our judgment, there are conditions or events, considered in the aggregate, that raise\nsubstantial doubt about the Plan\u2019s ability to continue as a going concern for a reasonable period of time.\nOur audits did not extend to the certified investment information, except for obtaining and reading the\ncertification, comparing the certified investment information with the related information presented and\ndisclosed in the financial statements, and reading the disclosures relating to the certified investment\ninformation to assess whether they are in accordance with the presentation and disclosure requirements of\naccounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\n\nAccordingly, the objective of an ERISA Section 103(a)(3)(C) audit is not to express an opinion about whether\nthe financial statements as a whole are presented fairly, in all material respects, in accordance with accounting\nprinciples generally accepted in the United States of America.\nWe are required to communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the\nplanned scope and timing of the audit, significant audit findings, and certain internal control-related matters\nthat we identified during the audit.\nOther Matter - Supplemental Schedules Required by ERISA\nThe supplemental Schedule of Assets Held for Investment Purposes at End of Year as of December 31, 2024,\nis presented for purposes of additional analysis and is not a required part of the financial statements but is\nsupplementary information required by the Department of Labor\u2019s Rules and Regulations for Reporting and\nDisclosure under ERISA. Such information is the responsibility of management and was derived from and\nrelates directly to the underlying accounting and other records used to prepare the financial statements. The\ninformation included in the supplemental schedule, other than that agreed to or derived from the certified\ninvestment information, has been subjected to auditing procedures applied in the audits of the financial\nstatements and certain additional procedures, including comparing and reconciling such information directly to\nthe underlying accounting and other records used to prepare the financial statements or to the financial\nstatements themselves, and other additional procedures in accordance with GAAS. For information included in\nthe supplemental schedule that agreed to or is derived from the certified investment information, we compared\nsuch information to the related certified investment information.\nIn forming our opinion on the supplemental schedule, we evaluated whether the supplemental schedule, other\nthan the information agreed to or derived from the certified investment information, including their form and\ncontent, are presented in conformity with the Department of Labor\u2019s Rules and Regulations for Reporting and\nDisclosure under ERISA.\nIn our opinion:\n\u2022 the form and content of the supplemental schedule, other than the information in the supplemental\nschedule that agreed to or is derived from the certified investment information, are presented, in all\nmaterial respects, in conformity with the Department of Labor's Rules and Regulations for Reporting and\nDisclosure under ERISA.\n\u2022 the information in the supplemental schedule related to assets held by and certified to by a qualified\ninstitution agrees to, or is derived from, in all material respects, the information prepared and certified by\nan institution that management determined meets the requirements of ERISA Section 103(a)(3)(C).\nMeaden & Moore, Ltd.\nCleveland, Ohio\nOctober 8, 2025\n\nSTATEMENT OF NET ASSETS AVAILABLE FOR BENEFITS\nEaton Corporation\nPension Plan for Eaton Corporation Employees\nDecember 31\n2024 2023\nASSETS\nReceivable - Employee contributions $ 19,663 $ 25,617\nReceivable - Other 4 7,203 4 6,662\nTotal Receivables 66,866 72,279\nInvestments:\nCommon collective money market funds - 1 ,535,841\nMoney market fund 3 73,051 3 9,085\nTotal Investments 373,051 1,574,926\nValue of interest in the Eaton Corporation Master\nRetirement Trust 2 ,444,854,622 2,602,779,673\nTotal Assets 2 ,445,294,539 2,604,426,878\nLIABILITIES\nAccrued - Administrative expenses 6 28,272 4 66,243\nNet Assets Available for Benefits $ 2 ,444,666,267 $ 2,603,960,635\nSee accompanying notes.\n-4 -\n\nSTATEMENT OF CHANGES IN NET ASSETS AVAILABLE FOR BENEFITS\nEaton Corporation\nPension Plan for Eaton Corporation Employees\nYear Ended December 31\n2024 2023\nChange in Net Assets Attributed to:\nContributions:\nEmployee $ 260,081 $ 281,585\nNet investment gain from participation in the\nEaton Corporation Master Retirement Trust 100,527,313 221,285,643\nInterest and Dividends 11,923 12,225\nNet appreciation in fair value 3 ,303 9 3,505\nTotal Additions 100,802,620 221,672,958\nDeductions from Net Assets Attributed to:\nBenefits paid to participants 243,853,443 233,527,272\nAdministrative expenses 1 6,243,545 1 7,828,635\nTotal Deductions 2 60,096,988 2 51,355,907\nNet decrease ( 159,294,368) ( 29,682,949)\nNet Assets Available for Benefits:\nBeginning of Year 2 ,603,960,635 2 ,633,643,584\nEnd of Year $ 2 ,444,666,267 $ 2 ,603,960,635\nSee accompanying notes.\n- 5 -\n\nNOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nEaton Corporation\nPension Plan for Eaton Corporation Employees\n1 Description of Plan\nThe following description of The Eaton Corporation Pension Plan for Eaton Corporation Employees (\"Plan\") provides only\ngeneral information. Participants should refer to the Plan document and summary plan descriptions, which are available from\nthe Company's Human Resources Department upon request, for a complete description of the Plan's provisions.\nGeneral:\nThe Plan, which began January 1, 1944, is a defined benefit plan that covers many employees of Eaton Corporation's\n(\"Company\" or \"Plan Sponsor\") United States operations. The Company is a subsidiary of Eaton Corporation plc (\"Eaton\").\nThe Plan provides for retirement and death benefits. The Plan is subject to the provisions of the Employee Retirement Income\nSecurity Act of 1974 (\"ERISA\").\nEffective January 1, 2002, the Company amended the Plan to provide that the majority of non-bargaining employees hired\nsubsequent to that date would participate in the Eaton Personal Pension Account (EPPA) Cash Balance Plan. In addition,\nparticipants who elected the cash balance plan as a one-time choice provided on January 1, 2003, also participate in the EPPA\nplan. The remainder of the participants are covered under an Hourly or Traditional benefit structure.\nThe Plan was amended to exclude from participation certain non-bargaining employees who are classified on and after April\n1, 2013 as new hires, rehires and/or certain transfers. During 2020, the Company amended the Plan to freeze benefit accruals\neffective January 1, 2021 for non-bargaining employees in the EPPA Cash Balance Plan and, effective January 1, 2026, for\nnon-bargaining employees covered under a Traditional benefit structure. Upon the adoption of certain collective bargaining\nagreements, bargaining employees who are classified on and after a specificed effective date as new hires, rehires, and/or\ncertain transfers may also be excluded from participation in the Plan and/or be subject to a freeze of future accruals.\nOn December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2021, the Cooper Pension Plan and the Cobham Orchard Park Plan were merged\ninto the Plan, respectively.\nThe Plan was amended and restated effective January 1, 2020. The Plan was most recently amended December 21, 2023 and\nDecember 29, 2024. It is intended that the Plan, as amended, shall continue to qualify as a defined benefit plan under the\nInternal Revenue Code of 1986, including any later amendments to the Code. Benefit multiplier increases occurring during the\n2024 and 2023 Plan Years have been reflected in the Plan's benefit obligation (see Note 5).\nFunding Policy:\nThe Company makes contributions in amounts sufficient to maintain the Plan on a sound actuarial basis. The Plan has met the\nERISA minimum funding requirements. The Company may also elect to make voluntary contributions to the Plan. The\nCompany has the right to amend and/or terminate the Plan subject to the provisions of ERISA.\nCertain Plan participants may elect to make contributions to the Plan each year based on a percentage of their compensation.\nParticipants' accumulated contributions (including interest earned on those contributions) at December 31, 2024 and 2023\nwere $4,382,481 and $4,178,404, respectively, with interest rates on accumulated contributions ranging from 5.00% to 5.25%\nand 4.62% to 5.00%, respectively.\n-6 -\n\nNOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nEaton Corporation\nPension Plan for Eaton Corporation Employees\n1 Description of Plan, Continued\nPension Benefits:\nParticipants are vested in their benefits earned under various methods defined in the Plan. Normal retirement age is 65.\nParticipants maybe entitled to earlyretirement payments based on the Plan document. Forms of payment include lump sum\noptions and various annuityoptions depending on whether the participant has a spouse and what type of joint and survivor\noption the participant chooses.\n2 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\nBasis of Accounting:\nThe Plan's transactions are reported on the accrual basis of accounting.\nInvestment Valuation:\nThefairvalueofthePlan'sinterestintheEatonCorporationMasterRetirementTrust(\"MasterRetirementTrust\")isbasedon\nthe beginning of the year value of the Plan's interest in the Master Retirement Trust plus actual contributions and allocated\ninvestmentincome(loss)lessactualdistributionsandallocatedadministrativeexpenses.WithintheMasterRetirementTrust,\nmarketablesecuritiesarestatedatfairvalue.Securitiestradedonanationalsecuritiesexchangearevaluedattheclosingprice\non the last business day of the Plan Year.\nThefairvalueofparticipationunitsownedbytheMasterRetirementTrustinthecollectivetrustfundsisbasedontheclosing\nprice,asreportedbythefundadministratoronthelastbusinessdayofthePlan'sfiscalyear.Fixedincomesecuritiesconsistof\npublicly traded United States and non-United States fixed interest obligations (principally corporate and government bonds\nand debentures).

Corporation Employees\nEIN/PN: 34-0196300 / 029\nSchedule SB, Part V \u2013 Statement of Actuarial Assumptions/Methods\nFunding assumptions and methods selection and rationale\nActuarial Standard of Practice No. 27 (\u201cASOP 27\u201d) provides guidance to actuaries on economic assumptions for\nmeasuring pension obligations. Actuarial Standard of Practice No. 35 (\u201cASOP 35\u201d) provides guidance to actuaries\non demographic and other noneconomic assumptions for measuring pension obligations. Under these ASOPs, for\neach assumption that has a significant effect on the measurement and that the actuary has selected, the actuary\nshould disclose the information and analysis used to support the actuary\u2019s determination that the assumption is\nreasonable. No information or analysis is needed for any assumption prescribed by law or regulation.\nThe interest rates and mortality assumption used for this measurement are prescribed by law.\nThe economic assumption that has a significant effect on the measurement and that the actuary has selected is\nthe expected rate of return on assets. An analysis using the Gallagher General Economy and Market Simulator\n(GEMS) Model is used to set the expected rate of return on plan assets.\nDemographic and other non-economic assumptions that have a significant effect on the measurement are\nannuitant mortality, annuitant mortality improvement, retirement rates, withdrawal rates and frequency of optional\npayment forms. The assumptions for non-annuitant mortality and non-annuitant future mortality improvement are\nprescribed by law. The assumptions for annuitant mortality, annuitant mortality improvement, retirement rates,\nwithdrawal rates and frequency of optional payment forms were selected by the enrolled actuary and are\nreasonable given historic gain and loss experience of the plan. The actuary has determined that these\nassumptions do not significantly conflict with what, in the actuary\u2019s professional judgment, are reasonable for the\npurpose of the measurement. The rates are monitored annually with updates made as deemed necessary.\nFor assumptions that apply to the former Cobham Orchard Park Defined Benefit Plan participants, the current\nassumptions were set by the prior actuary. We believe the current assumptions to be reasonable.\nUse of Models\nActuarial Standard of Practice No. 56 (\u201cASOP 56\u201d) provides guidance to actuaries when performing actuarial\nservices that involve designing, developing, selecting, modifying, using, reviewing, or evaluating models.\nGallagher used third-party software to perform the calculations that underlie the actuarial information contained in\nthis report. The model in the third-party software calculated the actuarial information provided in this report using\nplan provisions, data, and assumptions as of a measurement date under rules applicable to the calculations.\nGallagher has an extensive review process whereby the results of the calculations are checked using detailed\nsample output, changes from year to year are summarized by source, and significant deviations from\nexpectations are investigated. Other outputs are similarly reviewed in detail and at a high level for accuracy,\nreasonability, and consistency with prior results. Gallagher also reviews the model when software changes occur.\nThe review is performed by experts who are familiar with applicable rules and the way the model generates its\noutput.\nFuture actuarial measurements\nFuture actuarial measurements may differ significantly from current measurements due to plan experience\ndiffering from that anticipated by the actuarial assumptions, changes expected as part of the natural operation of\nthe methodology used for these measurements, and changes in plan provisions, applicable law or regulations. An\nanalysis of the potential range of such future differences is beyond the scope of this report.\n\nPension Plan for Eaton Corporation Employees\nEIN/PN: 34-0196300 / 029\nSchedule SB, Part V \u2013 Statement of Actuarial Assumptions/Methods (continued)\nPrescribed Funding Assumptions and Methods\nThe following assumptions and methods are prescribed by ERISA.\nInterest rates\nFor 2024 Plan Year: Full Yield Curve as of January 1, 2024\nEffective Interest Rate: 5.13%\nFor 2023 Plan Year: Full Yield Curve as of January 1, 2023\nEffective Interest Rate: 5.06%\nEaton and Cooper Pension Plan Mortality\nNon-disabled\nEaton specific mortality projected with MP-2021 Improvement Scale published by the Society of Actuaries\n(SOA) from the base year of 2015 for annuitants and mortality tables mandated by applicable law and\nregulation as specified in IRS Regulation 1.430(h)(3)-1, as amended in the Federal Register on October 20,\n2023, in TD 9983, 88 FR 72357, applied on a fully generational basis using the IRS 2024 Adjusted Scale MP-\n2021 Rates mortality improvement scale for non-annuitants.\nDisabled\nRevenue Ruling 96-7 disabled mortality for males and females.\nCobham Orchard Park Defined Benefit Plan Mortality\nMortality tables mandated by applicable law and regulation as specified in IRS Regulation 1.430(h)(3)-1, as\namended in the Federal Register on October 20, 2023, in TD 9983, 88 FR 72357, applied on a fully generational\nbasis using the IRS 2024 Adjusted Scale MP-2021 Rates mortality improvement scale.\nMortality for purposes of calculating lump sums\nFor Eaton, lump sum mortality is based on the 2024 IRS 417(e) Applicable Mortality table, as amended by IRS\nNotice 2023-73. For Cooper Pension Plan and Cobham Orchard Park Defined Benefit Plan, lump sum mortality is\nnot applicable.\nActuarial cost method\nThe Funding Target is the present value of accrued benefits based on compensation and service to date. The\nTarget Normal Cost is the present value of benefits expected to be accrued during the current plan year, reflecting\nthe effect of expected compensation increases during the year and including plan-related expenses expected to\nbe paid from plan assets during the year.\n\nPension Plan for Eaton Corporation Employees\nEIN/PN: 34-0196300 / 029\nSchedule SB, Part V \u2013 Statement of Actuarial Assumptions/Methods (continued)\nNon-Prescribed Funding Assumptions and Methods\nFor Eaton the following assumptions were selected by the plan\u2019s enrolled actuary. The asset valuation method\nwas selected by the plan sponsor with the actuary\u2019s advice and is an acceptable method under PPA.\nFor assumptions that apply to former Cooper Pension Plan participants, the current assumptions were set based\non an experience study performed in 2022.\nFor assumptions that apply to former Cobham Orchard Park Defined Benefit Plan participants, the current\nassumptions were set by the prior actuary. We believe the current assumptions to be reasonable.\nPlan Expenses\nExpected plan related expenses are equal to a 5-year average of expenses paid from the Plan outside of PBGC\npremiums, adjusted for inflation, plus the estimated PBGC premiums for the current year rounded up to the\nnearest thousand. For 2024 the estimated plan related expenses included in the Target Normal Cost are\n$24,610,000.\nSalary increase assumption\nFor Eaton wages and salaries are assumed to increase by 4.00% per annum for 2024 and 3.00% after 2024. This\nassumption is based on guidance from Eaton Corporation\u2019s expectations for the coming years.\nInflation\nFor Eaton the annual inflation increase is 2.75%. This assumption is based on 25-year historical data excluding\nthe period after the 2008 financial crisis but including expected future inflation.\nSocial Security\nFor Eaton the annual increase in maximum wage base is 2.75%. This assumption is based on the expected\ninflation assumption.\nCash Balance interest crediting rate\nThe interest crediting rate for Appendix CB is assumed to be equal to the forward rates for 30-Year Treasury\nSecurities as published by Bloomberg as of December 31, 2023. The interest crediting rate for Appendix ASD is\nassumed to be equal to the forward rates for 5-Year Treasury Securities as published by Bloomberg as of\nDecember 31, 2023. The interest crediting rate applicable to cash balance accounts of former Cooper Pension\nPlan participants is assumed to be equal to the forward rates for 1-Year Treasury Securities as published by\nBloomberg as of December 31, 2023.\nCash balance index credits\nFor opening account balances subject to indexing under Appendix CB are assumed to increase 2.75% per annum\n(in addition to interest credits) during active employment. This is assumed to be the same as inflation, which is in\nline with the basis for actual index credits to participant accounts as outlined in the plan document.\nCash Balance Annuity Conversion Rate\nConversion of cash balance accounts to annuity forms of payment for former Cooper Pension Plan participants is\nbased on the following assumptions:\nInterest \u2013 3.25% for 2024 and 2.75% for 2023.\nMortality \u2013 Blended 1971 Group Annuity Mortality projected to 1978 with Scale E (95% male/5% female).\n\nPension Plan for Eaton Corporation Employees\nEIN/PN: 34-0196300 / 029\nSchedule SB, Part V \u2013 Statement of Actuarial Assumptions/Methods (continued)\nNon-Prescribed Funding Assumptions and Methods (continued)\nCost of Living Adjustment\nFor Eaton the cost of living increase is assumed to be 2.75%, when applicable. This is assumed to be the same\nas inflation, which is in line with the basis for actual cost of living adjustments to participant benefits as outlined in\nthe plan document.\nMarital Percentage\nIt was assumed that 82.5% of the male salaried employees and 61.5% of the female salaried employees would\nbe married at the time of retirement. For former Cooper Pension Plan participants, it was assumed that 80% of all\nparticipants are married and that husbands are 3 years older than their wives. For former Cobham Orchard Park\nDefined Benefit Plan participants, it was assumed that 75% of the male participants and 65% of the female\nparticipants are married and that husbands are 4 years older than their wives. For all other participants, 85% of\nthe male and 65% of the female are assumed to be married. In each case the husband was assumed to be 3\nyears older than his wife.\nFrequency of optional payment forms and assumed commencement ages\n80% of cash balance participants are assumed to elect the lump sum option while 20% are assumed to take the\nannuity option. Of others who are eligible, 60% are assumed to elect the lump sum form of benefit payment. Other\noptional forms of payment were assumed based on the experience of each appendix over the last several years.\nOptional form elections are summarized in the tables below for actives and deferred vested participants.\nDeferred vested participants are assumed to commence benefits at age 62, if they are eligible for unreduced\nretirement. Otherwise, the assumed commencement age is 65. Assumed commencement ages for active\nparticipants vary based on the provisions of the applicable appendix. Active commencement ages are\nsummarized in the chart below.\nThe commencement assumption for terminating Appendix CB participants is 50% immediate commencement and\n50% deferred to age 62 commencement. For terminating Appendix CB participants over age 62, 100% immediate\ncommencement will be assumed. The commencement assumption for Appendix CB participants who are\nassumed to become disabled is 75% immediate commencement and 25% deferred until normal retirement date.\nWith respect to former Cooper Pension Plan participants, 15% of those with cash balance accounts are assumed\nto receive their benefit in the form of a single life annuity, 7.5% are assumed to receive a 50% joint and survivor\nannuity, 7.5% are assumed to receive a 100% joint and survivor annuity, and 70% are assumed to receive their\nbenefit in the form of a lump sum. Deferred vested participants with traditional deferred annuities are assumed to\nreceive their benefits in the form of a single life annuity. All future terminations with lump sum values under $15,000\nare assumed 100% to take an immediate lump sum.\nWith respect to former Cobham Orchard Park Defined Benefit Plan participants, 100% are assumed to receive their\nbenefit in the form of a single life annuity.\n\nPension Plan for Eaton Corporation Employees\nEIN/PN: 34-0196300 / 029\nSchedule SB, Part V \u2013 Statement of Actuarial Assumptions/Methods (continued)\nNon-Prescribed Funding Assumptions and Methods (continued)\nEaton\nAssumed Optional Forms for Active Participants\n50% 55% 60% 67% 75% 100% 5 Year 10 Year 15 Year Assumed\nLife Joint & Joint & Joint & Joint & Joint & Joint & Certain Certain Certain Lump Deferral\nPlan Annuity Survivor Survivor Survivor Survivor Survivor Survivor & Life & Life & Life Sum Age\nAppendix A 27% 7% 6% 60% 60\nAppendix B 30% 5% 5% 60% 62/63\nAppendix D 19% 21% 60% 63\nAppendix ASD 18% 1% 1% 80% Varies\nAppendix CB 18% 1% 1% 80% Varies\nArgo-Tech Hourly 58% 8% 1% 33% 65\nArgo-Tech Salaried 60% 11% 3% 26% 65\nAJ Hourly 44% 56% 62\nCC Hourly 100% 55\nCH Hourly 64% 13% 23% 63\nCH Hourly (Beaver\n34% 2% 4% 60%\n/ Horseheads) 65\nCL Hourly 46% 41% 11% 2% 63\nCO Hourly 23% 77% 55\nFW Hourly 41% 32% 18% 9% 63\nHU Hourly 60% 40% 64\nRX Hourly 31% 7% 2% 60% 63\nStanley Aviation 11% 29% 60% 65\nVJ Hourly 29% 41% 3% 5% 22% 65\nW Hourly 77% 20% 3% 63\nWR Hourly1 25% 25% 50% 63\n1 For 2026 and beyond, optional form probabilities will be the following: Life Annuity 12.5%, 50% Joint & Survivor 12.5%, 55% Joint & Survivor\n25%, and Lump Sum 50%.\n\nPension Plan for Eaton Corporation Employees\nEIN/PN: 34-0196300 / 029\nSchedule SB, Part V \u2013 Statement of Actuarial Assumptions/Methods (continued)\nNon-Prescribed Funding Assumptions and Methods (continued)\nEaton (continued)\nAssumed Optional Forms for Deferred Vested Participants\n33% 50% 55% 60% 67% 75% 100% 5 Year 10 Year 15 Year 20 Year\nLife Joint & Joint & Joint & Joint & Joint & Joint & Joint & Certain Certain Certain Certain Lump\nPlan Annuity Survivor Survivor Survivor Survivor Survivor Survivor Survivor & Life & Life & Life & Life Sum\nAppendix A 23% 6% 7% 5% 59%\nAppendix B 13% 5% 2% 5% 75%\nAppendix D 19% 21% 60%\nAppendix ASD 18% 1% 1% 80%\nAppendix CB 18% 1% 1% 80%\nAJ Hourly 44% 56%\nArgo-Tech Hourly 58% 8% 1% 33%\nArgo-Tech Salaried 60% 11% 3% 26%\nCC Hourly 100%\nCCA Salaried 11% 33% 56%\nCCC 13% 25% 13% 49%\nCH Hourly 73% 19% 5% 3%\nCH (Beaver /\nHorseheads) 8% 2% 4% 86%\nChallenger (Chr.)\nFormer Hrly 79% 13% 8%\nChr.
